Journal of a Moving Picture. The Sweet Darkness.,Anniversary2022,Captain Pierce found an old journal with sketches of people and creatures in elaborate costumes celebrating the ‘Sweet Darkness.’ It was signed… the Mad Designer. Another book by what I presume to be the same author showcased sketches of abandoned towers just like this one in the middle of the abyss. Pierce believes we should form parties to search for them. I think they’re just the sketches of a creative artist with lots of time on his hands.
Journal of a Moving Picture. Jezabel.,Anniversary2022,"Sam Park writes to his missing son every night without fail. I’d eventually like to read those letters for research. I cannot even begin to imagine what it would be like to lose someone you love and not know where they ended up. On another note, we found several other journals with absurd designs and characters illustrated by an artist who signs off as Jezabel."
Journal of a Moving Picture. The Mad Designer.,Anniversary2022,"Alex found a room filled with masks and other objects created it would seem from Jezabel’s designs. It seems to me that Jezabel and the Mad Designer are one and the same. She seems to have multiple personas and her designs seem to be quite bold and unrestricted. They are fun and horrific at the same time especially those that describes battles between towers. If there is any credibility to her sketches and notes, it would seem as though I was wrong and that there are several of these towers scattered throughout the abyss."
Tiny Awful Things,Halloween2021,"<b>Stories from the Witch Café. The Forever Horror.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone! Please enjoy today's special, Pumpkin Ghoul Pie with, may I suggest, a cup of Franken Spice Coffee while I do my best to entertain you with tonight's story. This one comes from a challenge I received from friends to tell a scary story that could go on forever. I'm not sure if it's as scary as it's gross, but it's certainly fitting for Halloween and it takes place in Medieval, Europe. I call this one, Tiny Awful Things, but my friends are telling me I should probably call it, The Forever Horror. Have a listen and let's discuss afterwards.<br><br>There was no doubt: Lucian was a coward. He was strong and clever and fast, but a coward, nevertheless. That's what made being drafted into the king's army and marched into battle all the worse. Not wanting to put himself in harm's way, Lucian thought of a clever plan to avoid injury or even death.<br><br>As soon as the horns blared and the infantry charged into the fray, Lucian executed his cowardly plan. He let loose a war-cry like none other, rushed forward with his sword raised, then, when no one was looking, when he heard the clash of iron and the agonizing screams of dying soldiers, he made himself tumble to the ground where he played dead and hoped for the best.<br><br>Lucian was so scared that despite the stink of rotting humanity he kept his eyes closed for several days until he felt someone or something tapping his shoulder. When he opened his eyes, he found himself staring up at a man in dark robes, holding a bloody scythe.<br><br>Lucian was staring at Death.<br><br>Or, at least, that's what he thought.<br><br>Actually, it wasn't Death at all, but a lower dimensional demon making the rounds, making mischief, pretending to be Death, looking for someone, anyone, to torment. And if you know anything about lower dimensional demons you know that they absolutely delight in tormenting cowards—cowards and narcissists.<br><br>And so, this lower dimensional demon stared at Lucian with glowing red eyes and told him his time had come and asked if he had any last requests. Lucian, of course, extended a trembling hand and begged for his life. As the demon laughed and shook its ugly head, a thought came to Lucian, and he quickly begged for one last meal.<br><br>The demon stepped back, smiled, and said he would entertain his last request. He told him he would allow him to live for as much time it would take for him to fill his belly with whatever he could find on this battlefield… no… not battlefield… buffet… this buffet of death.<br><br>Lucian didn't know what to do. He didn't know what to eat. He wasn't a cannibal, and he certainly didn't want to commit any kind of sin before dying. He was about to surrender to his fate when he felt something squirm by his hand. He looked down and that's when he saw the… tiny, awful things… squirming out of the bloated belly of a corpse… falling on his hand.<br><br>Desperate, Lucian did the unthinkable. With a miserable sigh, he plunged his hand into the rotting belly, felt around the stinking, oozing innards and soon pulled out a dangling white maggot.<br><br>Swallowing a thickness in his throat, he held the tiny, awful thing up in the moonlight, then opened his mouth and let the maggot plop onto his tongue. The demon winced in disgust, laughed in disbelief, then said some words in a strange, unknown language.<br><br>Lucian didn't understand any of it, but he thought he might have been cursed as he strangely began to feel a great insatiable hunger for maggots. More than this, he even began savoring them as one might savor a fine wine or coffee, enjoying, to his disbelief, the aftertaste.<br><br>I guess we can say that as a coffee bean soaks up the essence of the tree and land it grows upon, a maggot soaks up the essence of the corpse it feeds upon.<br><br>The demon smiled at Lucian as he desperately tried to delay the inevitable. When Lucian finally finished savoring the maggot, the demon told him his time was up.<br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been crushed by a club. Blood and gore spilled out of the eye sockets like spaghetti and meatballs. And there in the spaghetti and meatballs tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his greedy, salivating, tongue.<br><br>Robust. Earthy. Slimy. A velvety maggot that bursts with herbal notes and soothes with its fresh and bold character.<br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up.<br><br>But Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been diced into small pieces by an ax. Chunks of bone and intestine festered in pools of blood like stew. And there in the stew tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue.<br><br>Bold, yet fruity. Chewy. A sweet maggot with delicate hints of citrus.<br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up.<br><br>Lucian shook his head and said his belly wasn't full yet. Then he approached a corpse that had been trampled by horses and marching soldiers. Pieces of skull and brain fermented in bile and blood like a delicious dipping sauce for veggies. And there in the dipping sauce tiny, awful things squirmed. Lucian plucked another maggot and plopped it onto his tongue.<br><br>Herbal. Intense. Mushy. A full-bodied maggot rich in flavor.<br><br>The demon smiled at the coward and said his time was up…and as you can imagine the story goes on and on cause the demon enjoyed watching this coward grovel like a maggot for his life. And since it goes on and on, I would appreciate some help telling it… at least until we run out of tiny, awful things.<br><br>Please pass this bowl of putrid guts and gore around the Moonstone. I invite you to reach inside and choose a tiny, awful thing to savor.<br><br>Please feel free to describe its flavors and let's not spare any gory, juicy, mushy details.<br><br>Okay, okay. I confess… They aren't real maggots, but slimy, sugary things soaking in warm brandy and pumpkin guts… but let's stick our hands in anyway and have a little fun to help us get into the spirit of Halloween."
The Bell from Hell,Halloween2021,"<b>Stories from the Witch Café. The Bell from Hell.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the only place in town to get a story and a coffee. I can tell you where the coffee comes from, but please don't ask me where the stories and characters come from cause I basically have no clue. Some say it's the aroma of freshly brewed coffee that inspires me. Others say I'm able to tap into the endless memory streams pouring out of the infinite kettle that is the multiverse. I think it's a little bit of both. This one comes from the grains I observed at the bottom of my espresso cup a few days ago. It kind of resembled a bell… and so I'm calling this one… The Bell from Hell.<br><br>Toby and his sister Tina were always up to no good, and this time they snuck into the old, overgrown junkyard that many claimed was haunted. Despite the rumors, the teens played in the rusty wrecks, honking horns, kicking windshields, and, of course, scaring each other to hell.<br><br>'It's fun here!'' Toby said.<br><br>'It is!'' Tina agreed.<br><br>As the night wore on Toby hid in the trunk of an old sedan with the intention of scaring his sister. But Tina followed a trail he unwittingly left and—<br><br>RRRAAH!<br><br>Scared him instead!<br><br>Toby cursed, and Tina ran off promising she would get him, again. She quickly rushed to the old compactor and hid in a half-squashed station wagon filled with a strange, black fog. That's odd, she thought, and didn't think any more of it.<br><br>But she probably should have thought a little more of it since strange, black fog isn't exactly an omen as you know from my previous stories. Anyhow, Tina waited patiently in the backseat. When an hour passed, she began to worry. Slowly, she craned her head to peak out the window when—<br><br>RRRAAH!<br><br>Toby slammed the station!<br><br>Tina nearly jumped out of her skin, hitting her head against the ceiling of the half-crumpled car. Toby couldn't help but laugh, and as he laughed, he looked down into the churning, black fog and saw—<br><br>A bell.<br><br>A strange-looking, iron bell unlike any bell he had ever seen before.<br><br>''Will you look at this, '' he said, holding up the bell, examining the craftsmanship. Then he grabbed a stick from the ground and clanged the bell stupidly.<br><br>CLANG. CLANG. CLANG.<br><br>The ominous ring echoed through the abandoned junkyard as the black fog thickened and swirled around them. But before they could say anything about the strange fog—<br><br>The compactor came to life!<br><br>WHIRRRRRR!<br><br>Tina felt her heart fall into the pit of her stomach, and she screamed in horror!<br><br>Toby dropped the bell, grabbed her hands and yanked her out just in time. Breathlessly, they watched the station wagon as it creaked and groaned and shattered into scrap.<br><br>There was a long, tense silence as they wondered what had given sudden power to the otherwise rusted and broken compactor. Just then, the bell rang, again. This time behind them. Tina exchanged a look with Toby and swallowed a growing thickness in her throat. They turned slowly to face—<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Absolutely, nothing.<br><br>Nothing but the swirling fog.<br><br>It was probably just their imaginations.<br><br>Or was it…<br><br>For just as they released a collective sigh, the bell rang once again, and something suddenly materialized out of the fog. Within moments, they were face to face with a—<br><br>Wraith!<br><br>The Wraith instantly grabbed Toby by the neck with one arm and lifted him high in the silvery moonlight, his feet dangling, his arms flailing, his lips quivering with fear.<br><br>Tina gasped and stumbled back to her haunches. The Wraith smashed Toby against the ground with a powerful thud. He raised a rusted, wheel wrench and proceeded to bludgeon his head to scrap, blood and gore splattering everywhere.<br><br>Then the Wraith turned to face Tina with his creepy bell and dead eyes. Covered in her brother's warm blood, Tina screamed until her lungs gave out and waited… for the bell to toll.<br><br>Now what the siblings didn't realize was that they had entered a kind of dimensional pocket that had brought them to another world. See, there are these pockets or holes in the world that lead to all kinds of dark places… places that defy reality… dark places that make all our combined depictions of hell seem like a flower garden. But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just say that for Toby and Tina death was not an escape."
Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins,Halloween2021,"<b>Stories from the Witch Café. Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.</b> Welcome one, welcome all, to the Moonstone Café! Tonight, seeing as we just made a batch of Pumpkin Spice Cheesecake to go with our famous Halloween Latte, I thought a story about pumpkins might be fitting. This story was told long ago in a village that once stood very close to where we all stand now, and I call this one, Wrath of the Killer Pumpkins.<br><br>The widow's name was Ulla and more than anything she wanted to win the annual pumpkin festival. Not just for the prize money, but to impress her six-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who loved everything about pumpkins. Their texture. Their shape. Their color. Their smell. Everything.<br><br>But Ulla's pumpkins were nothing compared to her neighbor's pumpkins. Her neighbor Mona won the pumpkin festival every year, and she seemed to have a secret for growing perfect pumpkins.<br><br>That's not to say, Ulla's pumpkins were bad. They weren't. They just weren't very special. At best, they had been described by the great pumpkin judges as average. Average height. Average width. Average color. Average smell. Average. And average didn't win awards.<br><br>Well, not wanting to be average anymore, Ulla decided she needed to know Mona's secret. So, one morning she waited until Mona left for the market, and when she knew the coast was clear, she did the unthinkable. She snuck into her house.<br><br>To Ulla's amazement the kitchen was filled with glass jars containing pumpkin seeds of every variety. Each jar had a label that included a name, instructions, and some very peculiar symbols. Reading the labels, Ulla felt a cold shiver run through her body. She couldn't make sense of the names or symbols and for a moment, just a moment, she suspected witchcraft.<br><br>Part of her wanted to run, but the other part—the part that hated to lose—wanted a little help, a little boost, a fighting chance to win the festival and make her daughter proud.<br><br>Ignoring her better instinct to run, Ulla found a jar labeled: Mortafykuss Cucurruss. She scrutinized the label and read that these seeds would produce the biggest and brightest pumpkins but that they were still quite unstable. The seeds were unstable. Ulla winced, and she had no idea what that meant or how pumpkin seeds could be unstable. She continued to read a warning—<br><br>No blood. Especially at night.<br><br>She laughed out loud. Who in their right mind would feed a plant blood? Who would heed such a warning? And for a moment she really thought that maybe, just maybe, Mona was a witch, a powerful witch who could defy nature and modify and mutate seeds.<br><br>Despite the creepy warnings, Ulla borrowed one seed--just one-- from the Mortafykuss Cucurruss jar, convincing herself that she would give Mona back a seed from her winning pumpkin. With that promise, she convinced herself she wasn't stealing, and she quickly returned to her small, humble farm.<br><br>No sooner did Ulla return home than she planted the seed in her garden. To her amazement there was a visible pumpkin growing the very next day, and every day after that more pumpkins appeared linked to a thorny, green vine unlike anything she had ever seen before.<br><br>Well, to be sure, Rebecca jumped up and down with joy at the sight of the massive pumpkins. She couldn't stop hugging and measuring and sniffing the pumpkins.<br><br>When the time came, Ulla told Rebecca to choose a pumpkin for the festival, and as she selected the choicest pumpkin from the patch, she got so excited that she tumbled into the thick, green vines and cut herself against the thorns. The vines and pumpkins trembled momentarily with sudden life.<br><br>Ulla dismissed the sudden movement as the wind and proceeded to dress her daughter's wounds. Then she placed the chosen pumpkin on a wheelbarrow and pushed it to the market to face the judges of the great, big pumpkin festival.<br><br>It didn't take long to declare Ulla the winner. And Rebecca jumped up and down, and she screamed and celebrated that they had finally won the festival.<br><br>Ulla reveled in her daughter's joy and felt a great surge of pride.<br><br>But that joy was short-lived when Mona suddenly emerged from the crowd admiring the winning pumpkin and sniffing it as though searching for a signature scent. A tell-tale. Proof that Ulla had stolen one of her seeds. Then she put her ear to the pumpkin and locked eyes with Ulla. For a moment, it seemed as though she wanted to say something. But then, Mona smiled, gave the pumpkin a gentle caress, and walked away.<br><br>Ulla watched Mona until she disappeared, and she told herself she would gut her winning pumpkin and return a seed back to Mona just as soon as she returned home.<br><br>And so, with exhausted arms, Ulla wheelbarrowed her pumpkin down the dirt road with her daughter singing and skipping behind her in the moonlight. Caught up in the euphoria of winning, Ulla tried to skip with her daughter, but she missed a beat and twisted her foot on a stone.<br><br>Ulla stumbled forward, lost control of the wheelbarrow and the great, big pumpkin tumbled out, smashing against a massive stone.<br><br>Suddenly, mother and daughter froze in terror!<br><br>Thick, orange liquid like blood poured out of the busted pumpkin. Through the cracks they could see something moving… something… breathing…<br><br>Ulla approached the pumpkin slowly. She hesitated, then placed her fingers in the pulpy crack and pulled and pulled and—<br><br>WHAAAAH!<br><br>A pumpkin baby burst out!<br><br>And attached itself to her face!<br><br>Pulp dripping down her face and back, Ulla ripped the pumpkin baby off her face and smashed it repeatedly against the ground as it wailed and screamed and finally died. Then she dropped the limp, pulpy corpse in the grass and watched it melt into a thick, orange puddle of steaming, pumpkin puss.<br><br>Ulla grabbed her daughter by the hand and rushed home. But when they reached home… the whole farm had been overrun by gigantic, bright orange pumpkins and thick vines with thorns like knives.<br><br>Wanting to burn the pumpkin patch down, Ulla held her daughter close, and she led her to the shed as the vines trembled, slithered and brushed by their feet. Then, all at once, the vines coiled around their ankles and—<br><br>WHAAAAP!<br><br>Mother and daughter hit the ground as throbbing vines wrapped around them like hungry snakes.<br><br>Ulla stared in horror as massive pumpkins seemed to suddenly hatch like giant orange eggs in the moonlight. From those pumpkins came creatures staggering on two legs with long, clumsy vines for arms.<br><br>And as these killer pumpkins closed in on Ulla, she noticed they had orange and green skin and thick thorns for feet, and… the faces… they… resembled… her daughter.<br><br>Before she could make sense of what she was seeing, an evil vine coiled around her neck and head and thirsty thorns pierced her skin and gorged on her blood as hundreds of newborn pumpkin monsters wailed at the moon and a cold darkness swept over her.<br><br>As for the younglings… they grew and multiplied and went on a murderous rampage throughout the town. But, rest assured, they were finally stopped by a few good witches with some pretty powerful spells. But that's another story for another dark and creepy night. Let's just agree that we shouldn't mess around with pumpkin seeds and that we prefer to eat our pumpkins than be eaten by them."
Journal of a Moving Picture. Secrets.,Halloween2022,"A small group ventured into the fog and quickly returned, saying they had come across the ruins of a tower not unlike this one. Only inside this tower, instead of stories and Irish wine, they found dozens of flayed bodies and leather scrolls covered in tattoos. The tattooed messages and symbols are indecipherable. Could be messages and secrets about this dark dimension. Things learned. Things discovered. Perhaps even a way out of this infernal prison."
Journal of a Moving Picture. Human Books.,Halloween2022,"The cloaked survivor moved through the fog, trying to destroy the devices before it was too late. But the survivor’s attempt had been marred by the three Watchers who had somehow entered the minds of the prisoners. Through memories, visions, and dreams, they had been made to believe harnessing dark energy was their only chance to escape. That the devices would somehow open a doorway back home. But the cloaked survivor knew better. The cloaked survivor could see the dark energy was doing something else to the world and that the Watchers had something far more wicked in mind."
Something Wicked. All Hallows’ Eve.,Halloween2022,"We continued to search the fog where we discovered other abandoned buildings and tower-like structures. A few of us found more of these scrolls and strange instruments like the glowing blue contraption in the basement. The symbols on the scrolls seem very familiar to those found within the pages of Sam Park’s codex. Several of these ancient scrolls were returned to the House of Arkham, and upon further inspection, it was clear that the scrolls were made out of human skin and that someone had been hunting people with arcane symbols tattooed on their bodies. Strange yet fascinating to think that there are human ‘books’ walking around the realm with secret knowledge that could possibly help us better understand this loveless inferno. Could make for an interesting character in the moving picture I will eventually write, produce and direct. I imagine a character recording the secrets of the universe on his skin with cosmic ink that cannot be erased, smudged, or destroyed. But, in reality, he’s probably some ordinary Joe from a strange world who tattooed a grocery list on his body. Curious to learn more about these ‘human books,’ I spent time researching the Chamber of Blood for stories inspired by or referencing a character like him. No luck yet, though I did find one story about strange instruments attached to hooks and generators that could open a portal out of a hellish world not unlike this one. Could be our ticket out of here. I’ll keep digging."
Memory 1746,Tome01_Alchemist,"He moves through the death and decay of the void. He doesn't remember his name. Everything's a blur. He feels pain in his stomach. In his arms. In his veins. He needs… he needs to find one of those… flowers… the nectar… the sweet serum that gives… strength. Strength for what? He remembers… the killers… experimenting on them. Why? Why was he experimenting on them? He doesn't… remember. He caused a lot of suffering, but he doesn't feel remorse. He doesn't even know if he should feel remorse. He doesn't feel anything but an ache in the pit of his stomach for power."
Memory 1747,Tome01_Alchemist,He has flashes of The Doctor. His screams. His agony. Turning the tables on him. Experimenting on him like he had done with so many others. Where? Not here. Somewhere else. Another world. All of these… these… survivors… marooned from other… worlds… How does he know this? He doesn't remember… He remembers the experiments. What was he trying to understand? The nectar? The serum? The right dose? The right dose… to use without hurting himself. Too late.
Memory 1748,Tome01_Alchemist,He feels the hunger. Not for food or drink. Not for talk or fun. For a flower. A single flower. For serum. He knows The Entity is watching him. He knows it. Feels it inside his bones. He doesn't want to be snatched for another trial. To suffer or cause suffering. And to what end? The great horrible mystery of it all. He wants to understand this place. He does. But he senses that to know… to really know would drive him… mad. Madness. That's what this place is. The embodiment of madness. He doesn't want to be pulled into another trial. He wants to return home. He must return home. That's why he was studying the serum. It gave him insight. Insight to what? He doesn't remember.
Memory 1749,Tome01_Alchemist,"Home… he doesn't even remember where home is. He only remembers The Void. Hundreds maybe thousands of discarded survivors. Not dead. Not alive. Something else. Alive but dead inside. Burnt. Emotionless. Useless to The Entity. He remembers… he remembers rising from The Void, finding… a flower… Had this flower been his salvation? Had the flower been his way out? He falls to his knees and shouts at the abyss and the abyss answers with… silence. The silence is so deafening it hurts. He buckles over. Climbs to his knees. He needs… serum…"
Memory 1750,Tome01_Alchemist,"He's lost. He doesn't know where he is. He sees things like tentacles reaching out for him from the fog and he knows they're not real. None of it is. He's losing his mind if he hasn't lost it already. His eyes play tricks on him. He sees giant, nameless creatures looming over him. Doesn't matter. They're not real. None of it is. His hunger confuses him. Oppresses him. He'd do anything for that feeling again. Anything. Even… return to the trials. He would. He'd rip survivors and killers apart limb from limb for that feeling again. He begins to mumble words. A promise… one flower… one flower… and I will do anything…"
Memory 1087,Tome01_Claudette,"Claudette is seven years old and feels alone. Very alone. Yes, her parents love her. Yes, they want the world for her. But the world doesn't want her. Or, at least, that's what Claudette believes. She just wants to fit in. Fit in at school. Fit in with her cousins. Fit in with her teammates on the soccer pitch. But fitting in isn't as simple as being like others. She's different and she knows it.<br><br>She feels slow. Unresponsive. Not quick enough to understand her teacher or keep up with her class. The librarian calls her ‘addle minded.' When she talks, she stutters. Sometimes she loses her breath and has trouble recognizing when she's talking too loudly. But most of all her teacher embarrasses her. Says she's in the clouds. Always in the clouds. Get out of the clouds, Claudette! But she can't help it. She's exploring massive gardens and colorful bugs on strange new worlds."
Memory 1096,Tome01_Claudette,"Claudette will be eight-years-old tomorrow. She should be eager. She should be excited. She should be counting the hours, minutes, seconds… Instead, she is none of these. She dreads the moment she will have to open her gift. Every year it's the same. Dolls. Crafts. Jewelry. Nothing that means anything to her. Maybe this year she'll smile and pretend she didn't want a magnifying glass or a collection of stones or a set of books on botany. Maybe… to make things easier… she'll pretend. Maybe that will make her mother less scared for her. Seeing her happy about her grades felt good. Real good."
Memory 1088,Tome01_Claudette,Claudette feels things more than others. Much more. Like the shame of not being invited to any birthday parties. Not one party. Every day her parents ask her who she played with at lunch and every day she lowers her chin and tells them she doesn't want to talk.<br><br>Her parents ask her teacher and her teacher tells them she likes to play alone. Not so much play. More like collect and observe things. Flowers. Weeds. Beetles. Worms. Rocks. Some kids are just loners. Every day her parents ask her about her friends and every day the shame returns. They want her to have friends. More than that they want a list of names for her birthday. But she doesn't have a list of names. She doesn't even have one name.
Memory 1089,Tome01_Claudette,Claudette observes a beetle while her classmates chase one another around the playground. She wants to play but no one wants to be around her. She doesn't want to think about it. Thinking about it hurts. Thinking about it reminds her she will disappoint her mother again.<br><br>Her mother just wants her to have a friend. But making a friend isn't easy. Not for Claudette. And she wishes more than anything that it was as easy for her as it was for others. She wishes she had a friend to make her parents worry less. Maybe they would even be proud. Maybe she should give up her passion for bugs and flowers. Maybe that would help. Maybe then she would be like other kids. But the need to explore and collect is strong. It is not beyond her. It is her.
Memory 1090,Tome01_Claudette,"Claudette loves to collect things and she knows this is why many call her weird. Her father tells her she's perfect the way she is. He tells her a man named Darwin used to collect bugs and plants, too. He had a big imagination like her. He often mused on ideas and theories and boy did he come up with a whopper of a theory! He explains the theory, and she understands. Her father has a way of taking complicated ideas and making them easy to understand. Darwin. Claudette likes the name. She smiles. Stares at her favorite blue and green beetle and names him… Darwin…"
Memory 1091,Tome01_Claudette,Claudette's mom is crying. She's upset because Claudette is having trouble in school. Her grades are lower than they've ever been. She doesn't understand what she's doing wrong as a parent. Her dad says she's doing nothing wrong. He says Claudette's wired differently and that's okay. Her mom doesn't want her to collect plants and bugs anymore. Her dad says that's the best part of her and he doesn't need a child who fits some bell-curve. More than this he defends her. He tells her mother that the greatest treasures gifted to the world were from those who didn't conform. Who weren't normal. Who didn't fit some outdated bell-curve. Tolstoy. Tesla. Einstein. Shakespeare. Her mother doesn't care. A sudden cry escapes her lips. I don't want her to repeat the year.
Memory 1092,Tome01_Claudette,"Claudette hides under the covers pretending to be asleep. Pretending she can't hear the yelling. Her mother wants her to get special help, but her father doesn't want to alienate her. He's right. Claudette doesn't want other kids to know she needs special help. They'll laugh at her. She'll figure things out. She promises she will. Her new substitute teacher Mrs. Cahil is helping her. A lot more than the other teacher who always said she was in the clouds. Her father says stress is the worst thing for a child's developing brain. Leave her be! Let her grow at her own pace! Stress shrinks the brain. Destroys confidence. Kills creativity. He doesn't want her studying at lunchtime. Lunchtime is for real growth. Authentic growth. Growth unhindered by the pressure of tests and the fear of making mistakes."
Memory 1093,Tome01_Claudette,Claudette's mother is happy because her grades are improving. A single teacher can make a difference. Can make all the difference. Especially this teacher. Mrs. Cahil. Other kids call her strange and weird. But Mrs. Cahil isn't weird. She just gets it. She understands because she had a tough time learning when she was a student. This is why she makes an extra effort to help Claudette. To help her understand what she is explaining in class without alienating her.
Memory 1094,Tome01_Claudette,"Claudette is happy because her new teacher is helping her. Really helping her. She's learning new things every day. More than facts and vocabulary she's learning how to learn. Or rather, she's learning how she learns and that is the key. But her teacher is doing something else. Her teacher is talking to her. She's talking to her about her ‘issue' and how her ‘issue' is really a blessing in disguise if she can just learn how to succeed in a system that favors one type of ‘smart' at the expense of all the others. A system that frowns on taking chances or making mistakes when making mistakes and taking chances is what is needed for learning. For true learning. Her teacher tells her that she has passion and passion is everything."
Memory 1095,Tome01_Claudette,"Claudette knows she's not like other kids and she doesn't have to be. Things like ‘bell curves' and ‘ideal student' don't apply to her and that's okay. The ideal mold is a prison for those wired differently and her teacher has set her free. Her grades are getting better and a test is coming. She writes, visualizes, and imagines everything she needs to remember and somehow this works. The right teacher at the right time can make all the difference.<br><br>Her parents are proud. Very proud. But still her mother wishes she had friends. Still her mother wishes she liked what other girls liked. Her parents argue in another room about what to get for her birthday. Her mother wants to buy a new doll. Her father thinks she'd like something more related to bugs, plants and bacteria. The suggestion upsets her mother. He father defends her. See her for who she is and not who you want her to be!<br><br>Her mother goes silent. She suddenly releases a cry and says she doesn't want her to be bullied like she was bullied throughout school. Claudette's eyes go wide. For the first time in her life… she realizes… her mother's wired differently, too."
Arcus 01,Tome01_Entity,"I would start at the beginning, but I don't know when that was or how long ago I was banished to this prison. What I know is I've been observing and studying the inner workings of this Entity that had once been… well… an obsession. How ironic that I should be sentenced to live out the rest of my days in the very thing I sought to destroy. An obsession turned prison… as all obsessions are, I suppose."
Arcus 54,Tome01_Entity,"The atmosphere of the realms is dark and grim to say the least but also… everchanging. I've already remarked that the atmosphere is misty even foggy at times and that this fog feels alive. It seems to contain swirls and streams of memories or imprints of beings from multiple terra worlds. It is as if The Entity absorbs all the psychic energy and thoughts of beings it snatches as it journeys through the endless cosmos.<br><br>I've used the Auris to study the black fog and have come to three observations that will prove invaluable to finding a way home. First, the fog is rich in Auric particles leading me to believe this dimension is more conscious than it is material. Second, I should be able to manifest anything I am able to pull from rifts in the fog using techniques passed down from my family. Third… The Entity is far more ancient than we ever suspected back home and most of our theories and conjectures were wrong. The rich presence of Auric particles and cells suggest it is one of the Original Ones—an Ancient."
Arcus 142,Tome01_Entity,"The Entity is the cosmic embodiment of evil. Back home we witnessed how its very presence turns worlds inside out… how it seems to remove or extinguish any sense of empathy or compassion within communities… how it brings people to the brink of madness and… well… pushes them in. Now I understand it does all this in order to rip victims from their lives and have them play out an endless trial of terror that it presumably needs for its own survival. And there, perhaps, lies the key to its destruction… if an Ancient can be destroyed at all.<br><br>End the trials. Destroy its ability to sap dark nectar from victims like a cruel parasite feeding from a flower. At least the Archives affords me a better understanding of the Entity… why it moves from universe to universe, picking victims off and devouring worlds as though at a cosmic buffet. What I have yet to conclude is whether it is attracted to worlds that are brimming with darkness and madness or if it is in fact the catalyst of such darkness and madness."
Arcus 557,Tome01_Entity,"All planes of existence are a unique mix of conscious Auric particles and material particles. The Entity is almost certainly pure consciousness… The observable fact of existence is the material world responds to and changes with consciousness… collective consciousness is the key… The body, the home, the trial—all of it is an expression of The Entity's unconscious need for fear and terror.<br><br>The distinct observation in the specimens chosen by The Entity is that they all come from worlds that have failed to understand the metaphysical relationship between their thoughts and the world they live in. This is not by chance. It is, to my mind, self-preservation. Victims who know this truth and have honed their ability to manifest could be poisonous to The Entity. This leads me to believe The Entity is attracted to dark worlds because darkness and chaos are clear indicators that inhabitants have failed to connect the dots between the collective consciousness and the health of their world. The conclusion, then, might be that The Entity feeds off ignorance."
Arcus 731,Tome01_Entity,"Hard to tell when one day ends and another begins. The tower and the library help me cope, but it's hard to forget the truth of my situation even for a moment knowing everything I have is a lie. I have access to anything I want and yet I have nothing. The survivors continue to undergo the trials with the most brutal of killers. I continue to search the fog for the memories of those who found a way to escape. It sometimes feels like a futile search. But then again… I've got time on my hands… lots of time…"
Memory 1235,Tome01_Trapper,"Evan is fourteen years old and he knows something his father doesn't. The thought thrills him. Amazes him. Scares him. There is something his father doesn't know. Something the owner of one of the most profitable mines in all of Seattle doesn't know.<br><br>His father manages his workers with an iron fist. No. Not an iron fist. Brass knuckles. He calls them maggots. Groveling maggots. He's about to discover he's wrong. They're more than maggots. Much more. They're men. And men working together can bring change. One of these men is inspiring others to take their lives back. If they can stand together, maybe just maybe they can bring in the union. With the union they'll have rights. More than rights. They'll have dignity. Freedom. Time. Time to spend with their friends. Time to spend with their family. Time to be human. Evan knows something his father doesn't know… and he feels empowered."
Memory 1244,Tome01_Trapper,Evan find his sketches torn to bits. He puts the pieces together. All of them accounted for except one. He doesn't have the picture of his drowning mother. His father enters his room. Despair and dread overwhelm him. He waits for a blow that never comes. Instead his father tells him he has instinct and instinct is everything. He tells him he inherited his instinct from his side of the family. The same instinct that told him Evan was keeping something from him.<br><br>Don't pretend. I know. A few of your maggot friends sold you out for a few dollars. Evan starts but doesn't say anything. Can't say anything. The words are caught in his throat. He apologizes. His father says nothing. Walks away. Evan follows him to his bedroom where he sees… the picture of his dying mother… framed above the bed. His father tells Evan he will learn a lesson tomorrow. One he hopes he understands. Evan stares at his father and feels… hate… hate for the maggots who betrayed him and for his father… respect…. no… not respect… admiration…
Memory 1236,Tome01_Trapper,"Evan's father thrusts him to the ground. Calls him weak. Tells him he's got to stop being so nice to the maggots. Stop talking to them. Stop helping them. Keep them in line. Break them. Let them know who's boss. If you give them an inch, they'll take a yard. They're just using you! Evan knows better than to say anything. His father punched and broke his jaw last year when he showed weakness. This year he'd rather not sip dinner through a straw. This year he holds back. Bites his tongue. He wants to tell his father about the union. But doesn't. He feels ashamed. Torn between his loyalty for his father and his friends. Bob. Tom. Jim. They deserve more."
Memory 1237,Tome01_Trapper,Evan enjoys creating something from nothing. He's not an artist but he enjoys sketching and he hides his sketches from his father. His father forbids sketching. Sketching is for weaklings. Vagabonds. Gypsies. He wants Evan to do worthy things. He drags Evan to his most profitable mine. He teaches him how to manage maggots. He's hands on. Very hands on. Abusive. Violent. Brutal. The key is… to break them. Break their will. Break their spirit. Once broken a human is a tool that can be wielded to do anything. Broken. It's what he did to his mother. It's what he's doing to him. But… Evan still sketches. Sketching is defiance.
Memory 1238,Tome01_Trapper,Evan watches his father yell at one of his workers. He's sick. He wants to leave. But he's not allowed. He leaves… he loses his job. Evan feels for the man. Wishes he could do something for him. He wants to tell him things are going to change. The union is coming. The union is coming and with it a good wage and fair working hours. But the man's lungs are black and his stomach is rot. Too much stress. Too much acid. Not enough sleep. He collapses. His father doesn't care. Kicks him in the gut. Tells Evan to drag him out of the mine. Evan drags him out. For a moment he feels disgusted at the man's weakness and wants to put… this… maggot out of its misery. He's becoming his father and he's not sure if that's a bad thing.
Memory 1239,Tome01_Trapper,Evan's father forces him to set a bear trap in a dark forest. His father's obsessed with hunting bears. Always has been. Always will be. He tells him the story. Always the same story. He doesn't want to hear it but he will. His father was hunting with his brother when they ran into a grizzly bear. The bear tore his uncle's arm off and bit into his head. Evan's father jumped on the grizzly's back. Stabbed the bear endlessly. Killed the bear. Ripped open its stomach to retrieve his brother's head. Carried his brother's mutilated body ten miles to their family estate. This time it's ten miles. Last time it was five. His father grins. The story is changing with every telling. Sometimes Evan wonders if there even was a bear.
Memory 1240,Tome01_Trapper,"Evan's inspired in a way he's never been before. Furiously he sketches his father in a bear suit killing his uncle. He never met his uncle, but he's seen pictures. His uncle was a philanthropist. A bleeding heart. Disloyal. He would have run the business into the ground with proper wages and all that socialist crap. That's why he had to go. Evan doesn't have proof, but he knows. Deep down he knows his father murdered his uncle. Tied him up. Left him for a bear. There was no knife. No fight. No honor. Just a terrible death for a disloyal worm. Evan suspects all this and yet… he doesn't feel disgusted or ashamed. He feels something else. Something he's trying not to feel. Something… he won't admit to himself."
Memory 1241,Tome01_Trapper,"Evan looms over his father's bed and watches him sleep. He hates and loves him at the same time. Sometimes he wonders what his life would be like without him. He owes him so much and yet he's miserable and alone. He raises a massive grey stone and holds it there for a long minute that feels like forever. He could be free. Truly free. But he can't. Not like this. He could free himself in other ways. Accidents happen. Hunting accidents. Mining accidents. He could lure him into the bowels of the mine and ignite a stick of dynamite. No way he'd survive. But despite it all, Evan can't do it. His love is bigger than his hate. He owes him too much."
Memory 1242,Tome01_Trapper,"Evan sketches his father in a bear suit drowning his mother. He never believed his father's story. Something didn't feel right. His eyes. His grin. His lack of empathy. She was pulled into a current and never seen again. His mother… she was beautiful. Blonde hair. Blue eyes. Fun. Full of compassion. His opposite. She didn't just go out to swim one morning and never come back. She was getting in his way and no one gets in his way. Not even family. Especially not family.<br><br>Obedience or death. Evan's tired of obedience. Yes, he's loyal to his father but he's also loyal to his friends. They talk to him. Encourage him. Think he's a great artist. He has friends. He's never really had a friend. His father wouldn't allow it. Waste of time. They're using you. Yes, he's loyal to his father but he's also loyal to his friends. They deserve better."
Memory 1243,Tome01_Trapper,"Evan's father stares at him across the dinner table. He knows. Maybe he doesn't know but he senses something's amiss. He has that look in his eye. That look that tells Evan he's in for it. He chews on a fatty piece of rabbit and hopes his father doesn't say anything. He should have known better than to keep something from him. His father knows. He always knows. Last year Evan lost his cool on a man who said something about his mother. He almost beat the man to death with a two-by-four while his father watched and laughed. The authorities pulled Evan away. He smiled at Evan and knew what he wouldn't admit to himself. He enjoyed beating on that man. Not because of the insult. Not because he felt threatened. But because he felt… Powerful… His father smiled. Apple doesn't fall to far from the tree, eh"
Arcus 1513,Tome01_Unknown,"I have used the Auris to explore the memories of an unknown survivor who comes from a world where, from what I can gather, a cult for The Entity exists. It's not a surprise, or the first time I've seen such a thing, but the memories suggest she was a detective of sorts trying to prevent a cult sacrifice before she was snatched for the trials. I'm not sure what happened to her and will have to explore the fog to unravel more."
Arcus 1672,Tome01_Unknown,"I have culled imprints of a killer I have yet to observe. My best guess, judging by the nature of the crimes, is this brute is from Terra Dark. She lured men with love, robbed them of their savings and fed them to her pigs. Lovely. Efficient. And resourceful. The impressions of the memory are as follows…<br><br>…He stands framed in the doorway with flowers. A stupid smile on his dumb face. He has no sense that his days are numbered. Lonely soul made the trip for a wife. He thinks he'll get everything for a ring. Her land. Her farm. Her savings. Won't happen. Won't go as planned. Not as he planned, anyway. It didn't for all the other lonely souls who answered her classified ad. She peers at his eyes and thrills at his ignorance. His long, dumb face. His false sense of superiority. He wrote her a poem. How sweet. She'll cram it down his throat when he's convulsing on the floor. She takes his poem and asks about his money. He has it with him. Packed his savings in a bag and made the journey for a new start. He'll get more than he bargained for. Way more. To the bank with his money. To the pigs with him."
Arcus 4902,Tome01_Unknown,"Life is not life in this prison, and death is not an escape. It is merely the start of a new trial and most survivors are aware they are caught in something they will never understand. Why this is all happening is no longer obvious to me.

Memory 1782,Tome02_Doctor,"Imbecile. That’s what he calls Professor Blanchard. The imbecile is choosing two students to lead a research assignment in an abandoned farmhouse. Carter knows he’s going to be selected. He’s the best in the neuroscience program. The best at The Lery… The Lery… It could only be The Lery. The Lery or The Allan. Two institutions with a history of working with the government to push the limits of psychology beyond the code. Not beyond the code. Despite the code.<br><br>The papers coming out of The Allan amazed him. Captured him. Inspired him. Had he been Canadian… it would have been The Allan. Or what many called, Ravenscrag. The experiments they conducted were brilliant. Cutting edge. Mind-shattering. He wishes he were a student in the fifties studying under Lord Crag. The nickname patients gave the genius at Ravenscrag. Lord Crag returned from the trials with ideas. Not cautionary tales. Not disgust like the other bleeding hearts who condemned the doctors who would, anyway, be smuggled into his country and be given the highest positions in government in exchange for their discoveries. Lord Crag took the experiments he had heard about to the next level and Carter… Carter hopes to do the same. But not with this professor. Not with Blanchard. Dr. Blanchard. Dr… Bleeding heart Blanchard. He has no idea what real power is. Real power is freedom. True freedom. Freedom beyond the limits of ethics and morality."
Memory 1791,Tome02_Doctor,Bleeding heart Blanchard returns to the farmhouse with a group of men Carter’s never seen before. They look like government men. He suppresses a smile and tells them good-doctor got out of hand. Took things a degree too far. He barely got out alive. Blanchard tells him to shut up. His tone is different. He doesn’t sound like an imbecile. We taped the whole thing. Carter exchanges a look with the men in black suits. He doesn’t understand. The imbecile enters and does the unexpected. He stares at the barely breathing student unperturbed. No fear. No panic. No emotion. Nothing. He grins and mumbles something to himself in German. He turns to Carter with a smile. His smile turns to a grin when the men in black suits handcuff and arrest him. Blanchard whispers. Looks like you had your chance to make merry hell and took it. The cuffs are just for appearances. I… I… don’t understand. Yes… you do. You understand much more than the others. Welcome to MKAwakening.
Memory 1783,Tome02_Doctor,"Carter’s leading the research assignment with another peer. The challenge: Secure the secret word through the good-doctor-bad-doctor interrogation technique put forward by some other bleeding-heart imbecile at some other institution. He’s bad-doctor. Bad-doctor with a code… a list of dos and don’ts the imbecile gave him. Very limiting. Too limiting. Self-limiting, even. How is he supposed to secure anything with these limits? Surely he realizes how futile the experiment is with this code. Nevertheless, he tries. He shouts at a fellow student sitting across the table from him. Shouts? Big deal. Tell me or I’ll… shout again. The student doesn’t take him seriously. He’s play-acting fear. It’s all make-belief for him. I should smash his skull and yank the secret word out of his sub-standard, mediocre brain."
Memory 1784,Tome02_Doctor,Second day and nothing. Carter’s frustrated. Really frustrated. At least they’re tied up. All seven of them. But it’s still not enough. They need to take the interrogation to the next level. Deprive them of food and water. They’ll talk. When their cells begin to self-cannibalize… they’ll talk. Better yet… he wants to deprive them of sleep. Sleep deprivation… Removes masks. Lowers guards. Makes prisoners talk for the promise of a few minutes of sleep. The seven prisoners stare at him. They know they’re safe. He can see it in their eyes. Limits. No one got anywhere respecting limits. He despises his colleague. Good-doctor. He’d have the secret by now had he been working alone and without a code.
Memory 1785,Tome02_Doctor,"Ridiculous limits. Skinner knew better. Put his own kid in some kind of a box for years just to see what it would do. Huxley worked for the secret service and wrote truths as lies in Brave New World. War of the Worlds was another great test in mass propaganda. The power of the radio to induce fear and anxiety in an unsuspecting audience. The power of fear and anxiety to inspire silence and indifference and create perfect consumers. Ethics. Morality. Limits. For sheep, not shepherds.<br><br>Carter feels anxiety unlike he ever felt as he watches good-doctor interrogate one of his classmates. He approaches him from behind with a piece of wood. Something he found on the ground. Raises the make-shift club. Before he realizes what he’s doing he pounds the good-doctor’s head. Pretend fear becomes real fear as his fellow students stare at him in horror. No more good-doctor. No more rules. No more limits… except the limits of his imagination."
Memory 1786,Tome02_Doctor,Carter ties a student to a chair. Warm blood drips everywhere. He twists pieces of flesh off his face… The sheep look away but never up. With terrible moans and squirms he gets a secret word from each and every one of them: New. Reich. Horizons. Fourth. Bird. Kill. His classmates beg to be released. They sob and agonize in their chairs. They plead the experiment is over. You have the words! You win! We’re done! Carter smiles. He’s still got a few days. A few more days and a few more experiments to run. Could put his career at risk… but… he’s got the good-doctor to take the fall. I’ll take what I learned from Lord Crag and lobotomize these imbeciles and manipulate… no… not manipulate… manufacture… yes… manufacture reality.
Memory 1787,Tome02_Doctor,"Music blares. Eyes are kept forced open with toothpicks. Carter piggybacks a looping song with an inaudible subliminal frequency to evoke fear, anxiety and discontent. He experimented with the loop on his parents. Always caused a fight between them. He doesn’t remember where he got the loop. He first read about the subliminal frequency from advertisers. Advertisers deny subliminal loops work. Of course, they do. Advertisers deny they use subliminal loops. But… they do. They use them, and they work. They must. They must because peace and contentment is our natural disposition. War and discontent needs to be instilled, enforced, manufactured, repeated over and over again until it’s the main script in the collective consciousness.<br><br>PAPERCLIP. BLUEBIRD. MKULTRA. MKDELTA. MKSEARCH. They were all necessary. Lord Crag had the right idea. Good instincts. So did the Black Sorcerer and the Dirty Trickster. They inspired all the goodies he brought with him in his bag. Music. Drinks. Drugs. Lots of drugs. For a moment just a moment he hesitates. He’ll probably go to jail for a long time if he uses his goodies. But… being free… being truly free for a few days… is worth a lifetime of imprisonment. But I won’t get caught. Good-doctor will."
Memory 1788,Tome02_Doctor,"Carter wonders if he can remother these sheep. Remother. He loves the term. He wishes it was his own but it’s not. Shock them with electricity and expose them to endless images of death, chaos and destruction. Traumatize the brain. Empty it. Lobotomize these subjects to remother them with new personalities. He wonders if he could remother these sheep into wolves. Get them to kill each other. Better yet… turn these good, law-abiding students into serial bombers. He rips the plug out of a lamp. Splits the wires. Peels the wire. Places the exposed wire into a student’s mouth. Slowly approaches the socket taking in his terror. Plugs it in. Screams as he remothers this exemplary student. A putrid smell of burning hair and skin reaches his olfactory receptors. There’s another stench. Imbecile soiled himself. Carter laughs. He hasn’t been this stimulated in ages. To be free. Ah… to be truly free."
Memory 1789,Tome02_Doctor,"Carter hasn’t had this much fun since he first tried to transplant a mouse brain into a rabbit. A week isn’t enough. He wishes he had more time. He needs more time. There are new avenues within the mind to explore. Too many avenues, not enough time. He wishes he had the tools to operate on their brains. There are knives in the kitchen. Could work. Not surgical precision. But… but enough. He’s read about a gland in the brain that looks like an eye. A gland that supposedly secretes DMT. A kind of mystical drug. He wonders if he can extract it from a living subject. He wonders what a good dosage of human DMT does to a test subject."
Memory 1790,Tome02_Doctor,Carter unties a rope. He’s going to release good-doctor. He’s pumped him with drugs and programmed him with new thoughts. He believes the other students are Russian spies that need to be executed for national security. He unwraps the rope and places a screwdriver in his hands. He changes his mind. Removes the screwdriver. Replaces it with a fork. Changes his mind again. Replaces the fork with a spoon. He’s never seen a spoon used to kill a human being. He backs away from good-doctor who is lost and confused. Remothered. He says a phrase. The moon is down. Confusion becomes clarity as good-doctor stands and approaches the Russian spies with… a spoon. Brilliant.
Memory 5823,Tome02_Jane,Jane needs a job. She has a job. She works as a waitress at a local diner. She needs another kind of job. A role. A part. Something. Anything to let her know she’s on the right path. Anything to let her know she deserves more than a school variety show. Acting is a fool’s pursuit! One in a billion her father says. Her grandfather agrees but adds… those who have the courage to follow their dreams have a ninety nine percent chance at being that one in a billion. Have courage. Courage will put the odds in your favor. Jane loves her grandfather and wants to make him proud. Wants to show him he’s right. I’ll be that one in a billion.
Memory 5824,Tome02_Jane,"Mexican waitress speaks in Mexican and English with a Mexican accent. Who wrote this? Mexican isn’t a language. Doesn’t matter. You get the gist.

Why is this important to the scene? Jane stares at the director, trying to understand his needs. It brings flavor. What does that mean? It doesn’t bring flavor. It perpetuates a stereotype. Yet… Jane says nothing. She says nothing because she doesn’t want to be blacklisted as a social justice warrior. Doesn’t want to be called a complaining minority. With a slight Spanish accent, she finishes the audition."
Memory 5825,Tome02_Jane,Jane shares a beer with her friend Dwayne. Dwayne tells her how a creative executive hired him to be the co-writer of his terrible script. To be the spokesperson of his terrible idea. To validate his insensitive cultural appropriation of an African American story. The creative executive wants to make a minority film because it’s a fad. The quickest way to be recognized. The fast track to fame for a hack. Many writers told the hack his script was wrong on so many levels. Badly written. Disrespectful. Boring. Insensitive. Dwayne refused to accept a script that was disrespectful to his cultural heritage. Refused to attach his name to a project so the executive could avoid accusations of cultural appropriation. Refused to validate an entitled interpretation of a minority story. The executive discredited Dwayne by calling him a social justice warrior. Fired him. Jane sighs sadly for her friend. At least the script won’t get produced. Dwayne raises a skeptical eyebrow. The hack has a friend with money. Lots of money. He’ll write. Direct. And produce. Entitled hacks with friends in high places. It’s how bad movies get made. They toast bad movies. Jane laughs. Not because it’s funny. Because it’s true.

But scripts for her are few and far between. Nothing beyond the stereotype. Her agent shouldn’t care. He should put her forward for all the female roles in her age range. She can play any female role, lead or support and yet she only gets auditions for the Spicy Latina or the funny immigrant or the waitress with the accent, never just… woman… American. That’s all she wants. She stares at the snowy television. Tries to visualize herself as the star of a show but can’t. The phone rings. Her agent. An audition. A major part in a play and it pays well.

How everyone thought she was just fantastic. He goes on about something else. She waits for the but… the proverbial but… a thousand compliments negated by one single, all-destroying… but… It doesn’t come. She listens to trivial notes and waits for the polite rejection.

Sorry."
Memory 5828,Tome02_Jane,Dwayne helps Jane rehearse at a café. They take a break and he tells her the hack is now doing a Chinese story and is desperately searching for a Chinese writer to validate his most recent abomination. Jane laughs. Hacks with money. It’s how bad movies get made. She tells Dwayne things are going well with the play. She doesn’t have to do an accent. Doesn’t have to wear a mini skirt or perpetuate a ridiculous stereotype. Doesn’t have to do all the stupidities she had to do in the past. This is a real gig. A meaningful gig. A gig she can share with her family. She knocks on the table. Dwayne laughs and says it isn’t wood. She shrugs. He says he’s happy for her and hands her a cut-out from a magazine. Open audition for Quick Talk. He says he put in a good word for her. She’d make a perfect host. She thanks him but the play takes all her time. Too bad. You’re the most real person I know and that’s what the show needs. Authenticity.

His ex has moved on and she doesn't want to see his face. Something about being a shithead. He can't live in a hotel room forever. It drains the account. He remembers a face he recently spotted in a crowd at his last scrap. They were friends since they were toddlers. He was a genuine friend even if they went separate ways. King looks him up. Castledrive. He hails a taxi."
Memory 343,Tome02_King,"King hasn't felt real in a long time. He sits in Donnie's apartment drinking old ale, realizing how much he misses genuine heart-to-hearts. Donnie was his friend before he realized he came from money. The rich aren't really rich. He's not sure why he thinks this or what it means. It's just a random thought. The ale talking as it were. Donnie says he can stay until he figures things out. He's not sure when that will be. It doesn't matter. A sudden rap at the door startles him. Donnie stands. Opens the door to reveal a few men in black leather jackets. Muscle. King doesn't hear much. What he does hear he doesn't like. Donnie owes money and can expect a bundle of lead in the face if he doesn't pay. He laughs when he returns to the kitchen table. It’s your fault, King. I don’t know who to bet on anymore."
Memory 344,Tome02_King,"King lost his last three jobs and is going back to what he does best. A challenger steps into the circle in the dimly lit alley. Double his size. Massive. King doesn't care. A head's a head. He'll go down like the others. Crowd calls him the Ghetto Masher. The Ghetto Masher glares at him. The ref spits out rules he’s heard a thousand times. King stares at him… and sees… not his father but his opponent.<br><br>A bell sounds. With a bestial snarl, the Ghetto Masher lunges. King evades a wild blow that would have ripped his head off. He feels strange. Unresponsive. Confused. Donnie screams at him. He glances at him as he receives a massive fist to the skull. Black swirls across his eyes. He doesn't remember the thud against his skull. He doesn't remember his legs buckling. He doesn't even remember collapsing in a pile of festering, garbage. He only remembers waking up on the couch in Donnie's apartment. He’s lost his edge. His anger. His rage. His hate. Was that all he was? Donnie's asking if he's okay and he's not sure. Am I okay? Will I be better? I don't know. Was it just a fluke? A lucky shot? Happens to the best. I feel wrecked. I am wrecked. Donnie bet the last of his cash on him."
Memory 345,Tome02_King,"King's getting the hang of working behind a bar. Donnie sips a beer and tells him he needs to find another reason to fight. King tells Donnie he needs to get home before the beer he’s drinking turns to piss. Before he gets in trouble. Too late. King spots two men. They approach Donnie. Grab him. Usher him into the basement. Not a good sign. King rushes to help but his manager yells at him to stay behind the bar. Screw it.<br><br>He leaps over the bar and rushes to the basement where he finds Donnie being beaten by Ghetto Masher with Uncle Brass watching in his chair. King doesn't hesitate. He tackles him. They exchange deadly blows. Ghetto Masher can hardly keep up. Uncle Brass sends others after King. Doesn't matter. King's a whirlwind of destruction. He cracks Ghetto's knees and thrusts his thumbs into his eye sockets. An eyeball pops out still attached to a series of nerves. Cries of terror. Ghetto Masher cups his eyeball screaming for medical help. Staggers and slams against the wall as more ruffians attack. Stop! Uncle Brass stands and approaches. It’s well within my power to rip your fuckin head off for what you did to my boys. King staggers to his feet. Not a bloody joke, am I? His debt is paid if you work for me. He straightens up and brushes his jacket. Smiles. Always bet on King."
Arcus 328,Tome02_Observer,"There is a curiosity at the core of every thinking person. A need for knowledge from uncharted and unknowable territories, but what is discovered in those blank spaces of the abyss… of the cosmos are things far too immense to understand. Things better left unobserved lest they undermine our sanity. Better to embrace ignorance than face the truth of our insignificance in the grand scheme of it all. Against the vastness of the infinite we are mere microbes swirling in an endless, indifferent cosmic stew. I say stew… but The Entity is probably more of a blood pudding."
Arcus 9082,Tome02_Observer,"Max has quite an arm. A famer made his way out of a barn and with one well-aimed blow with a spade, his head was severed from his shoulders and two spouts of hot blood burst from his body like geysers. He watched the headless man stagger stupidly and collapse in a growing puddle of steaming blood. I have to admit I’ve gone through this memory more than once. It’s one of my favorites. I find Max disturbingly amusing and the illusion of death fascinating… at a distance."
Arcus 7547,Tome02_Observer,"Whiskey deep into the night. A strange aftertaste… a flavor from a world which makes the best whiskey. Whiskey dreams are some of the most pleasurable. Dreams of home, with friends and family, enjoying time lost. When my senses returned, I realized I had turned my palace of a prison upside down. I remembered none of it. Everything, a drunken blur. So many paintings and statues I had created from memories from other worlds… shattered… I’m losing my grip on reality and maybe that’s a good thing. One day merges into the next and I’m lost in a storm of whiskey, screams, and endless streams of broken memories."
Arcus 3212,Tome02_Observer,"From a window I see something moving with an uncanny light. Through the black fog it shines there, beckoning me. And yet, I cannot leave. I cannot move. I can only bring things to me through the Auris. What light is this? Is it a creature sent by the Entity? Is it a survivor? Or perhaps it’s a marooned soul from back home searching like myself for a way back. An unnatural wind whines and I stare at the moving, hypnotic light, a hideous watching eye, trying to reach out to me, trying to tell me something, trying to convey something in its strange, rhythmic movement."
Arcus 345,Tome02_Observer,"I have recently wondered if survivors realize the titanic significance of their thoughts and feelings, and of how the Entity uses them to furnish the trials. Thoughts and feelings that bring me glimpses of what it’s like to have lived on a parallel world as someone else. It helps pass the time."
Arcus 1043,Tome02_Observer,"I look and observe the realms of the Entity with eyes that see disharmony, chaos, fear, and terror… and yet I acknowledge I may be swayed by appearances and that there may be another truth beyond the veil and it feels futile if not absurd to try to put to words what I am seeing."
Arcus 767,Tome02_Observer,"The Auris was little understood back home, and to be fair I wasn’t given the chance to explain its merits to the council. Had they taken the time to understand they would have realized that though I had no verifiable explanation for how the Auris works… I had theories, and the most reasonable was that the Auris works on the basis of the Trinitarian—the Trinitarian of Creation—a concept long held by our ancestors and forgotten throughout the ages. But the concept isn’t complicated, isn’t witchcraft, isn’t a secret. It simply suggests that it takes two things to create a third. A father and a mother to create a child. An idea and passion to create something new, something real, something lasting and meaningful. A thought and feeling. Therein lies the best theory of the Auris and how it is able to create with auric particles.<br><br>The failing of other pioneers back home is they believed thought alone was enough when in reality it is only half the equation… the other half is emotion, for it is feeling and passion that fuels the fires of creation. The Auris amplifies and manifests and forges something new using the mold of thought and the fires of passion. Or… I’ve been here too long and I’m grasping at theories to pass the time."
Arcus 293,Tome02_Observer,"Things could have been worse. I could have been banished in a dimension without auric fog containing the memory imprints of countless victims, memories that keep me entertained and busy with my coin and spirit collections… and the music… the variations from parallel worlds… it helps pass the time. In a twisted way I think what I’m admitting is that I’m glad the Entity takes what it wants when it wants from the omniverse."
Arcus 632,Tome02_Observer,Through a rift I believe I culled another memory of Vigo manifesting reality within the Entity with something reminiscent of the Auris. How he came to understand the machinations of the fog is both puzzling and inspiring. It suggests to me that perhaps this place enhances one’s connections to our infinite selves throughout the omniverse.
Arcus 9873,Tome02_Observer,King has this way of doing things that are quite amusing. One of my favorite memories I return to time and time again whenever I need a lift is memory 2332. Gasoline Man. King grabs this man who skipped a few payments on a loan. He drags him by the hair and throws him in an alley. He grabs a metal gasoline container and douses the ‘sod’ with its contents and lights a match. He stares at him through the flickering flame as the man screams in terror. He watches him beg for his life. Then he flings the match. The man’s eyes pop out of his head as the flame hits his chest and falls to the floor with a sizzle. King tells him to make his payment or next time he’ll use real gasoline. Brilliant.
Arcus 893,Tome02_Secrets,Several survivors went mad trying to escape the trial. They had with them memories of previous incarnations so that one survivor began dashing his head against a wall convinced he was reliving a nightmare he had just escaped. The other survivors drowned him in mud to shut him up. It seems to me survivors are torches growing dimmer and dimmer with every trial. Some stop to feel altogether and are doomed to the void. Others go raving mad and need to be silenced by others.
Arcus 223,Tome02_Secrets,"I felt an uncanny and unseen presence in the Archives as I contemplated The Entity. I could hear the labored breathing of killers standing outside my prison. I looked out into the dark, raging fog and saw nothing… Either the Entity is aware of my presence and is preparing to send killers to put an end to my plans… or the memories of survivors are somehow merging with my personal memories and these sounds are mere side effects of overusing the Auris. In the end it doesn’t matter. If I could end the Entity I would even if it meant my own demise. My life is little to pay for the salvation of the worlds it will destroy."
Arcus 1032,Tome02_Secrets,"Jumbled experiences of brutal killers and weird rituals of godless brutes from worlds too dark to care. I jerked myself straight out of one memory that pulled me into a cavern of bodies with an odor so repugnant I was retching for hours. I still have that horrible taste in my mouth and shudder at the thought of that smell, that horrible smell, rotting humanity. What foul creature of a man had made this festering hole his lair is beyond me."
Arcus 7456,Tome02_Secrets,"I am taking notes under incredible mental strain. I have had flashes of survivor memories overrun my senses all day, and I am trying to focus on home and gather myself. I haven’t used the Auris for some time and yet I have been pulled in and out of these lives randomly. These records… these archives will, I imagine help me remember myself should this Auris nudge me into the abyss."
Memory 5100,Tome02_Spirit,"Rin sits at her desk dreading the end of the school day. Not because she enjoys junior high or because she respects her teachers, but because she despises being forced to learn kendo. But her father demands it. He demands that she practice the way of the sword. Not just practice. Excel. She's a Yamaoka. The Yamaoka’s come from a proud legacy. A samurai legacy. He reminds her of this every day, and every day the kids tease and humiliate her, telling her she has no business in their class, telling her she should wield a broom not a shinai. She ignores them and tries her best. Maybe if she excels with a katana, her father will feel better. He hasn’t been himself as of late. Frustrated. Irritable. Reactive. She can’t do anything right. Nor can her mother. He has become very quiet and talks and argues with himself. She doesn’t understand what’s happening to him, but she knows he is suffering and the last thing she wants is to add to his pain. Family is everything and maybe one day she’ll be okay with wielding a katana. Maybe she’ll even enjoy it."
Memory 5101,Tome02_Spirit,"Rin's bones feel brittle and ready to collapse under the weight of the armor. She holds her bamboo shinai up to her opponent. I want this to be over. Can’t this just be over. Her opponent insults her. He tells her there's a shattered window in the changing room she ought to clean before someone cuts themselves. Janitor-Yamaoka. He laughs. He makes another janitor joke at her expense. A sudden heat rushes up her face. She wants to shove the shinai down his throat. See how he laughs with wood and splinters piercing through his stomach.<br><br>Splinters piercing through his throat? Where did those thoughts come from? It’s not like her to think such thoughts. She angles her shinai and feels something strange inside. She's never felt anything like it before. Like… like a waking dragon in her heart. She stares at her grinning opponent. Faster than thought she lunges and strikes the head of her opponent. Everyone laughs at him. His head slumps in mingled defeat and humiliation. A boy stares at her with wide, disbelieving eyes. He blinks. You might be a Yamaoka after all. She hates to admit it but… it feels good to win. No. Not to win. To defeat a foe. To defeat another human being. Defeat another human being? Why would I think this? These aren’t my thoughts. But they are."
Memory 5102,Tome02_Spirit,She doesn't understand what happened. What thing came over her to give her the strength to contend with the boy in front of her. He isn't laughing anymore. He glares at her. She beat him. Not once. Not twice. Thrice. The boys continue to stare at her openmouthed. Something is changing in Janitor-Yamaoka. They know it. She knows it. She feels the waking dragon in her heart. It's the closest she's ever felt to being… a fighter… a warrior… a Yamaoka… and she likes it… likes being treated with respect… likes being taken seriously. For an instant she imagines herself beside the great Renjiro Yamaoka and his son Kazan. Something tugs in her heart and the dragon stirs… and the dragon… she realizes… is the waking of her raging Yamaoka blood.
Memory 5103,Tome02_Spirit,"Janitor Yamaoka! You got lucky! Let's see how lucky you really are! Boys close in on her. Cursing. Jesting. Shouting. She wants to run but doesn't see an opening. She wants to apologize for being good with a shinai, but the waking dragon inside her heart won't allow it. She didn't do anything wrong. She has no reason to apologize. She finally did what she was supposed to do and now they close in on her as though she had cheated… as though they could see the dragon that had helped her. She feels scared. Where is that dragon now? Where is the spirit of her ancestors?<br><br>She raises a pleading hand for her abusers to stop. You will pay! You made me look foolish! For a moment there is an opening between two boys and there’s no hesitation, only action. She charges through and storms across the school yard with a group of angry boys in pursuit. She quickly ducks behind a garbage bin and watches the boys run past her. One stops… turns toward the bins… narrows his gaze. She holds her breath. She can hear her heart pounding in her head. Why hide!? You are better than these peasants! Stand and show them who you are! But she does not reveal herself. She hides and wishes that waking dragon to go back to sleep."
Memory 5104,Tome02_Spirit,"Rin emerges from hiding and begins her long walk home. The dragon in her heart admonishes her for hiding. Tells her she is more than her tormentors and should never cower before bullies and abusers. She’s not sure what she should have done or what she should think. Maybe she should have faced them. Maybe she should have confronted them. Maybe she should have beaten them down and torn them limb from limb. Limb from limb? What am I thinking? Where did that come from? Limb from limb?

She won’t let the fear paralyze her. She’ll use the fear and the pain to feed the dragon. Today her bullies will feel teeth and claws… they will feel her wrath… and they will learn… she is a Yamaoka!"
MEMORY 2112,Tome03_Dwight,"Lazar approaches Dwight and slams his desk. Max didn't work out. He was a weak male I just wanted to crush! Fear, anxiety, confusion—Dwight feels them all. How is this guy the CEO? More than that… he wanted to crush the employee he's replacing for being… for being… a weak male. Dwight doesn't even know what that means. Weak male? Who talks like that in this day and age? His hands fidget nervously. He swallows a growing lump in his throat. Lazar smashes his desk again. I need you to be bolder than him, Dwitch. I need you to get the buzz out there that we're the best company in the business. Did he just call me Dwitch? Dwitch? He just called me Dwitch. Dwight's still not sure what he's supposed to be doing at Peak 22. He's a Story-Hook Supervisor. He has no idea what that is. Sounds convoluted and made up. Sounds like bullshit. He took the job because he needs the money and he can't dress up in costumes for birthday parties anymore. Kids can be so cruel. He's supposed to create fake profiles and write positive reviews about Lazar and his company. Lazar gives his desk another thump! Be a lion, Dwitch! Pounce on the internet! Pounce! Get the word out! Peak 22! We design Story-Hooks for ads that transcend humanity. Dwight has no idea what that means. Lazar leaves a test on his desk and walks away. Dwight stares at the test unsure. Rose, the manager who hired him, approaches him and explains it's an intelligence test. Lazar wants to make sure he's the smartest in his company. Best advice. Flunk it. Dwight smiles. Gotchya."
MEMORY 2121,Tome03_Dwight,"Max hands Dwight a mix of his laughing drug. It will make him giggle and laugh so much he'll piss his pants. Pour it in his coffee right before his meeting and you'll have a ‘Story-Hook' unlike any other for next year's roast. Dwight smiles. He feels his heart pounding his chest. Rose will have justice. Everyone will. Dwight will teach this abuser that sometimes the little guy bites back. Inspired, he asks one of his colleagues to distract Lazar while he spikes his coffee. Another colleague listens to the plan and shakes her head skeptically. She isn't sure. She doesn't like this prank and cautions Dwight to think things through. I've got two kids, she says, and the last thing I want is for the investors to close down shop because he hallucinates or hurts someone. Dwight laughs. Don't worry. The most that will happen is he'll act like a donkey. Dwight lifts his chin proudly and reassures her no one will get hurt. He places his hand on her shoulder and feels like the leader he always knew he's been. Nothing bad will happen or my name isn't Dwight."
MEMORY 2113,Tome03_Dwight,"Our thing is Story-Hook advertising. Dwight cringes every time he hears Story-Hook. Lazar's trying to be different just to be different. Most advertisements use stories to wrap a message in emotion. Just because you call it a Story-Hook doesn't mean it's new. Doesn't mean it's different. Story-Hook is a term used by high-school English teachers. Rose laughs. Yes, but Lazar's an idiot and he wants to feel like he created his own theory for his upcoming book. Dwight's eyes go wide. Book? What book? Rose laughs absurdly and explains. An autobiographic book. A guaranteed bestseller highlighting Lazar's new theory on creativity. But Lazar hasn't done anything yet. It's all smoke and mirrors. Rose laughs and corrects him. He's done one thing really well… He's burned through millions. Rose changes the subject and tells Dwight he needs to meet Lazar's ghostwriter for an interview. Make sure to shower praises about our naked emperor for his autobiography."
MEMORY 2114,Tome03_Dwight,Dwight approaches Rose. She isn't her usually jolly self. Dry tears line her cheek and her eyes are swollen. She tells him Lazar embarrassed her at a meeting when she refused to go along with his jokes at the expense of the sound designer's speech impediment. He humiliated her for not going along with his stuttering impression. Rose sighs and advises Dwight to record all meetings with the Naked Emperor. Not just for legal reasons but for the yearly roast. Dwight raises his eyebrows curiously. Yearly roast? What yearly roast? She tells him about a yearly gathering of ex-employees who get together to laugh at Lazar's stupidities. Dwight tilts his head. He's really confused. In his mind Peak 22 just opened its doors. How long has Peak 22 existed? Rose calculates on her hands. Five years. Dwight can't believe his ears. Five years and Peak 22 has nothing. Rose smirks. Correction. Five years and we almost have Lazar's biography and his theory on creativity.
MEMORY 2115,Tome03_Dwight,"Dwight showers Lazar with online praise using fake profiles. It's the coziest job he's ever had. As he prepares to create another false profile he suddenly hears shouts coming from Lazar's office. He freezes as Lazar verbally assaults the Peak 22 lawyer. The lawyer is telling him Story-Hook can't be registered. It's a concept in many high school textbooks. Lazar fires the lawyer on the spot. The lawyer promises he'll sue. Lazar doesn't care. He'll settle. He always settles. It isn't his money, and Dwight's heard he's got his benefactors eating out of the palm of his hands. He's already settled dozens of wrongful dismissals. Rose attempts to calm Lazar down, but he screams at her to mind her business. Dwight wants to help her… but… he's… never made so much money doing so little before. He likes making money doing nothing. But… his hands are fidgeting and his palms are getting damp and clammy. Hearing Lazar verbally abuse Rose is difficult to bear. He imagines all kinds of scenarios where he leaps from his desk to help her. Nervousness fills his bladder, and he leaps from his chair and rushes to the bathroom."
MEMORY 2116,Tome03_Dwight,"The Brilliant Mind Inc. Lazar announces the title of his autobiography to the entire office. It feels like a joke, a bad joke, but it's not and the studio is trying not to laugh at their Naked Emperor. Lazar hasn't done anything in the five years since he convinced a bunch of millionaires in his Story-Hook revolution. He doesn't even have one successful advertising campaign. They had a few clients in the beginning, but Lazar wanted to write and direct the commercials himself and made a mess of everything. Dwight suppresses a laugh. Rose claps when Lazar concludes his presentation. Amazing! Paradigm-changing! How gracious of you to share the secrets of your success with the world. Everyone gets her sarcasm except Lazar. That's the thing about narcissists. They believe their own press release. Lazar turns his attention to Dwight. Dwitch… What do you think? Dwight suddenly feels the blood drain from his face. He echoes Rose. Amazing! Paradigm-changing! How gracious of you to share the secrets of your success with the world. Lazar smiles. It's not about ego Dwitch, it's about community and selflessness."
MEMORY 2117,Tome03_Dwight,Lazar screams at Rose because she can't find a publisher for The Brilliant Mind Inc. Peak 22 has done nothing and creating campaigns with a Story-Hook isn't really paradigm-changing. The publishers think he's an idiot. What is he saying Story-Hook when he means Story? Ads with a story. A story with a Story-Hook. Rose calms Lazar down. She suggests that they should self-publish. The idea silences Lazar. You're right! You're absolutely right! The publishing world isn't ready for my visionary ideas. Dwight sighs and finds it harder and harder to listen to his bullshit. Peak 22 is going nowhere fast. The company is having a hard time finding clients and recruiting with all the rumors of abuse. Lazar announces he has a solution for recruitment. He'll write a Story-Hook recruitment campaign to attract the best employees. Hundreds will apply. Thousands. Dwight doesn't understand. For what? Dwight still isn't sure if Peak 22 does anything other than enable a narcissist to do whatever he wants to whomever he wants.
MEMORY 2118,Tome03_Dwight,"Lazar is spreading rumors about Rose. Dwight consoles her but she's inconsolable. She says it's a pattern. His pattern. He discredits, destroys, and demolishes an employee before he fires them. He spreads the rumor he later uses to fire the person. Dwight says she's exaggerating. Rose shakes her head. Lazar's in trouble. He just spent more money on a one-minute ad campaign for Peak 22 than a Hollywood blockbuster and his investors want answers. He needs a fall girl. Someone to blame for the mismanagement of company funds. Dwight doesn't understand. She explains that Lazar's already left a trail of blood in his wake. The last three women in her position were all promoted and fired for Lazar's excesses and stupidities. Lazar has an upcoming meeting with his investors. She will be this year's patsy. Dwight gives her a skeptical look. She shakes her head. You'll see. He spends the money. A woman takes the fall. That's Lazar's idea of equal opportunity."
MEMORY 2119,Tome03_Dwight,"Dwight stares in disbelief as Lazar asks Rose to present the advantages of Story-Hook advertising at an all-hands meeting. He interrupts her on every slide in front of everyone then cancels the meeting. He acts as though it's the first time he's seen Rose's deck. He announces Rose has no idea what a Story-Hook is. Everyone leaves the cafeteria feeling bad for her, grumbling that no one knows what he means by Story-Hook or how stupid he is for using a contrived term that just means story. Dwight doesn't understand because she validated every slide in her deck with Lazar. He heard them agree. Before Dwight can talk to her she is fired and escorted out of Peak 22. Dwight watches his friend, a single mother, walk out. This year's patsy for Lazar's excesses. He siphons the investment money and his friend gets the boot. The whole meeting was a set-up to discredit her in front of everyone. Lazar approaches Dwight. Sorry, Dwitch, I know Rose was your manager but I had to let her go. She wasn't aligned with our company values. Dwight stares at Lazar in mingled shock and horror. What values? He wants to scream at Lazar. He wants to grab his ears and rip them out of his narcissistic head. Instead he nods and silently prays there is justice in the world."
MEMORY 2120,Tome03_Dwight,"Dwight listens in disbelief to stories of Lazar. Real life horror stories. Stories that defy reason for this day and age. It's a yearly ritual for those who have had the misfortune to work with Lazar. They've all gathered to watch the leaked Peak 22 recruitment video. Dozens of people, each wearing a white Peak 22 t-shirt with a ridiculous Lazar quote they scribbled on with marker. One of them worked with Lazar at a production company where he tried to produce a terrible web series he wrote. It's about an alien computer that takes over the world and controls its inhabitants with a matrix that simulates reality. No one told him he just pitched the premise of a major blockbuster film. She imitates Lazar selling his web series. It's different. It's unique. It's not horror, it's not sci-fi… it's terror… sheer terror… it's… it's a new genre… it's Simulated Terror. Lazar believed he had created the next big genre like cosmic horror. The writer shows a book written by Lazar. Simulated Terror. Guidelines for writers in his new genre. They all burst out laughing. Dwight laughs so hard it hurts. Who says Story-Hook when they mean story? Or Simulated Terror when they mean sci-fi? The stories of the Naked Emperor continue throughout the night and Dwight is convinced there is no justice. Peak 22's ex-Story-Hook supervisor talks about how Lazar called him a ‘weak male' for not wanting to ‘cyber bully' a blogger for using the term ‘Story-Hook.' He tells them about a harmless drug that makes people laugh absurdly at every little sound. He says if he was still working at Peak 22 he'd give Lazar a little taste of his own medicine. Others agree. That would be hilarious. Dwight likes the idea. Likes it a lot. It might be that justice works in mysterious ways. He approaches Max. Tell me more about this harmless drug."
MEMORY 2432,Tome03_Huntress,Dawn bleeds across the craters and trenches and into the devastated forest. Explosions tear the ground. Mud rises and showers Anna. Men tumble headlong into open craters filled with rotting cadavers. Mangled human and horse flesh make a feast for rats. Other men are blasted to bits and pieces. Some drown in mud and blood. The brutal savagery of these human animals amuses Anna. She's never been so entertained. They are worse than hungry wolves fighting over a carcass. Some speak words she understands. Others speak words foreign to her ears. A pathetic scream like nothing she's heard suddenly startles her. She follows the source of the sound into the decimated forest where she sees a small canvas tent and Russian soldiers guarding foreign prisoners. She watches them all evening. She watches horrified when they execute one of the horses for dinner. So much meat wasted due to sloppy butchery. After dinner the Russians grab one of their foreign prisoners and crush his head with a shovel to pass the time. They laugh and make jokes. She watches them in the shadows and laughs silently. Not with them. At them. A shovel is clunky. The blows are awkward. The death… messy. These men are neither fish nor meat. Her mother taught her better.
MEMORY 2433,Tome03_Huntress,"She was going to search for another pack of human animals but something catches her eye. Something that reminds her of her father. Something perfect for her little bushka. A gift. Anna hides in the shadows and fixes her gaze on the gift. The Russian soldier carves the gift as he guards and swears at foreign prisoners in the shredded canvas tent. They kill and torture each other because they cannot talk to one another. She remembers a book her mother once had. She pointed to the pictures and called them soldiers. They were the ones who butchered her father. Soldiers tear each other apart for reasons her mother could never explain. She watches them and doesn't understand. She's not sure they do either. Maybe they like the hunt, the scent of fear, the bloodlust. She stares at the perfect gift and wants to give them a little war they'll never forget. But there are too many and her mother suddenly appears before her with a smile and tells her little Anna she will need to thin the ranks. I can do that. I will show you. I will show you, and I will show them… where crawfish sleep."
MEMORY 2434,Tome03_Huntress,"The Russian soldier does a peculiar thing to his prisoner. He ties him to a gnarled branch by his ankle and lights a fire a few inches under him. She scrunches her brow. Confused. You kill the game before you roast it. But these soldiers enjoy his agony. She recognizes the yelling and shrieking foreigner. Just a few moons ago he was torturing Russian prisoners in another tent. Just a few moons ago he was the tormentor. The Russian holds the perfect gift in his hands while the prisoner shrieks and squeals like a pig. She smirks. It's kind of a funny cry. It is. It's amusing. The Russians make jokes and imitate the squealing cry. She fights down explosive laughter. It's the most ridiculous sound she's ever heard. The sound of an approaching soldier suddenly startles her. She wheels to see a glittering bayonet rushing her. She evades and grabs the pathetic, scrawny man by the neck, curls her callused fingers around his bulging apple and yanks with devastating fury. With a choked gurgle he collapses and lies dead on the ground with his throat torn out. She returns her attention to the laughing Russians and the squealing human swine. She smiles. They'll all be making similar sounds when she's through with them."
MEMORY 2435,Tome03_Huntress,"Four Russian soldiers lurk around the tent searching for their missing comrade. Anna stealthily tracks one soldier, inching closer and closer with every step. Poor pea-green mule. He has no sense these will be his last few breaths. She watches him for a long moment then strategically steps on a twig. The crack makes him turn, but before he meets Anna's gaze, her axe splits his nose between the eyes, smashing his teeth and severing his tongue. She covers his bloody mouth with her hand as she rummages through his pockets for the perfect gift. Nothing. She raises her hand to let the choking, gurgling sounds lure the other three. Carefully they approach with bayonets raised and ready. She grinds her teeth in fury and bloodlust. She rolls their comrade's severed head in their midst. A moment of shock and it's all she needs as she leaps out and drops two soldiers with one lash of her axe. The other soldier rushes in with a scream and she meets him with a sweeping stroke that severs his head clean off the torso. A geyser of blood erupts as his headless torso staggers stupidly back and forth as though searching for its lost head. The torso staggers forward then pitches backward and collapses. The sounds of another attack reach her before the blade. She lashes left and right and the body collapses in mangled pieces. The soldier stares at the pieces of his body around him in terror. She laughs and thinks about that story her mother used to tell her. Sorry yaytso. Can't be put together again."
MEMORY 2436,Tome03_Huntress,"Anna finds these soldiers curious. Where once the Russians and foreigners were roasting each other alive… they are now… working together to survive her attacks. They are calling her a ghoul, a monster, of the forest, saying she is a bodark. Together the soldiers dig pits and sabotage their camp. Anna toys with them. She's outnumbered and she knows it. She weakens their senses by depriving them of sleep. Every night she approaches their camp. Sings a lullaby then howls like a bodark. The soldiers wake in a frenzy and scuttle in terror as she returns to her cabin to sleep with her little one. She rests for a few hours then returns to her little war to reignite a cycle of terror. One or two sleepless nights and they'll be ripping each other apart. It will be a matter of walking in and taking what belongs to her little bushka."
MEMORY 3221,Tome03_Kate,"Hitting zero. That's why she returns to the forest time and time again. To let go of her anxieties. To let go of her problems. To take in the scent of fresh pine and let go of her conscious self. To let go of everything and listen to her muse. She's been out of touch with herself for a while, lost in a game to please everyone else except herself, playing songs that don't come from her but are sure to please the masses. Music that doesn't even resonate with her. Playing songs for money despite the warning: play one song for money and kill your muse. She laughed when her mother first told her this. It's seemed like a ridiculous thing to say. Her muse didn't seem to be going anywhere. She was hearing more songs in her head than she could play in a lifetime. Now… now…she's not laughing anymore. She's never felt so false and uninspired in her life, and more than ever she wants to reconnect with her music… her muse… herself. She closes her eyes and peels away the layers until her mind is empty and open to the great unknown."
MEMORY 3222,Tome03_Kate,"Kate strums her guitar freely but nothing's coming to her. Just a dark, disturbing melody that's been returning to her every time she hits zero. A melody so unlike anything she's ever played that she doesn't know where the inspiration comes from. She's never played a tune so dark and yet… so catchy. The harder she tries to push the ominous melody out of her mind the stronger it gets. The more it demands to be written down. She wants the melody to stop and yet it's all she hears around her. Above her. Below her. Beside her. Within her. One endless foreboding melody. A melody that just isn't her. Or.. maybe it is her… Maybe the show-pony routine has changed her, corrupted her… perhaps even crushed her. And if not her… the best part of her… her muse. She stops strumming, closes her eyes, pushes everything out of her mind and begins a slow and patient countdown back to zero."
MEMORY 3223,Tome03_Kate,"She waits for an inspiration that never comes. Nothing except that lonely, ominous melody. The more she tries to strum something else… the louder it echoes in her mind. She stops for a long silent moment. But… the tune doesn't. She closes her eyes and tries to force it out of her mind but… it's not in her mind. It's coming from the cave. It can't be. She shakes her head. The tune fades as she returns to zero and tries one last time to connect with her muse. Her real muse, regretting all the paid gigs that drove her further and further from who she was… who she really was. She closes her eyes and counts down. Five. She relaxes her toes. Four. She relaxes her legs. Three. She relaxes her torso. Two. Her hands. One. Her lips, her nose, her face. Zero. She silences her thoughts."
MEMORY 3224,Tome03_Kate,"Three hours and still nothing but that foreboding melody. More than anything she wishes she had taken some time to realign herself and make sure she was spending her life's energy on something real and true to who she was. Instead she squandered her life's energy on… acts and routines and her piggy bank. That wasn't supposed to happened. Not to her. One of her inspirations was the great Woody Guthrie. Everything he wrote was true to who he was. Everything he did came from him. Came from a real and pure place. She was like that at some point in her life. But now… now she's performed more fluff than substance and the guilt alone may have crushed her muse. Her real muse. Not this perverted version of a thing that has her strumming the loneliest and darkest tune she ever conceived. She prepares to countdown but sees… a symbol on the ground before her… glowing and pulsing with the tune… pulsing like the heartbeat of some primordial, ancient thing. She closes her eyes and opens them again and the symbol is gone."
MEMORY 3225,Tome03_Kate,"Kate screams in the lonely, desolate forest! She wants that tune out of her head. It's annoying her. Frustrating her. Blocking her. Even when she stops strumming her guitar the melody continues as though with a life of its own coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time. She focuses for a moment and realizes the melody is echoing out from the cave. She surrenders to her dark muse. She stands and stares at the cave and sees… a pulsing light. She closes her eyes and feels that her mind's playing tricks on her. But she knows better. She knows she's always sensed and felt things others couldn't. She once heard someone say that today's shamans are our artists, authors and musicians… that unlike other people they are capable of accessing other thoughts, worlds and ideas from otherworldly realms. She always had that ability… but never like this… never so dark… it's as if the universe is punishing her for squandering her gifts. She approaches the deep and ominous cave wondering who or what is calling her. A vague memory tugs at her… tells her she's done this before. She has a sense that she knows what she's going to find but somehow has forgotten…"
MEMORY 471,Tome03_Legion,"Julie hears a voice above the greasy spoon chatter. So you an artist or something? She turns to see Frank. Artist? Hardly. I doodle to escape the banality of Ormond. He stares at her sketch. He seems to recognize himself standing in line for a hot chocolate. That me? She feels sudden warmth running up her neck. She already knows before he tells her that he's not from Ormond. He looks different. Fun. Free. Rebellious. He sits beside her and offers to model for her with a laugh. They stare at each other for a long, stretching moment. She decides to invite this charming stranger to a party she's throwing at her house for a friend who just got fired. Joey can't seem to keep a job. With a laugh he says, Joey sounds… normal. You know how much programming it takes to get a human being to accept the whole eight-hour-a-day routine? He continues ranting about how school isn't education but brainwashing. If it were real education… If it were true education the core subjects would be philosophy and critical thinking. Julie laughs and knows her friends are going to love this iconoclast. She certainly does."
MEMORY 480,Tome03_Legion,Frank won the bet and he's collecting. Joey didn't last a month at the new job. The owner accused him of stealing a chocolate bar and now he paces the cabin hysterical. Of all the things… a chocolate bar! A chocolate bar he claims he never stole. The injustice of it all. Julie suggests payback. Let's break into the store! Get some more supplies! Set the whole place on fire to let Ormond feel the wrath of The Legion. Joey freezes when he hears the name. Frank raises a curious eyebrow and then nods approvingly. I like it. I like it a lot. She throws them generic masks. Plain. Bland. Unimpressive. The only thing we need now is a proper mask.
MEMORY 472,Tome03_Legion,"She didn't stop thinking about him since she first saw him. Now she hopes he shows up at her party. His rant stuck with her and she spent&nbsp;a few hours&nbsp;researching how education was corrupted to meet the demands of the industrial revolution. Conveyer belt education for assembly-line jobs. Nothing has changed for the last hundred years. Only the products. Frank shows up with drugs and drinks. Party treats. Julie introduces him to her best friends Joey and Susie. They talk&nbsp;favorite foods,&nbsp;slasher movies and killers all night. Julie amazes Frank with her profound knowledge of serial killers as she&nbsp;leads him to her bedroom and&nbsp;shows him her scrapbooks filled with pictures and clippings of famous murderers. Everyone leaves or passes out while Julie and Frank discuss murder and mayhem trying to one-up each other with details and trivia. Julie wins with a story of the abandoned cabin where&nbsp;the&nbsp;Soldiers&nbsp;of Mayhem&nbsp;hang out,&nbsp;plan and wreak havoc on the unsuspecting sheep of Ormond.&nbsp;&nbsp;Frank laughs and calls bullshit&nbsp;on the story.&nbsp;No such thing as the Soldiers of Mayhem.&nbsp;He read enough about Ormond&nbsp;to know&nbsp;that nothing&nbsp;of the sort&nbsp;happened&nbsp;at&nbsp;the resort&nbsp;cabin.&nbsp;Nothing but bad business and bankruptcy.&nbsp;Julie laughs.&nbsp;This story, Frankie, happens in the future.&nbsp;She&nbsp;grabs a black felt marker and&nbsp;writes&nbsp;Soldiers of Mayhem on his&nbsp;white shirt. He smirks.&nbsp;I like the idea,&nbsp;but I&nbsp;hate the name.&nbsp;Julie shrugs. It's a work in progress."
MEMORY 473,Tome03_Legion,"Julie feels alive with Frank. More than alive. Complete. At first she thought he was an iconoclast rebel but soon realized he just liked to argue and push buttons for fun. He thrilled as much as she did to smash beliefs and watch people unravel. Not just people. Ugly people he called them. It's the name he gave to those people who need to be right… who always need to be right. They were the easiest to push over the edge. Ormond was full of them. Ugly people. Entitled preps and politicians who would turn blue in the face if you challenged any of their beliefs. Julie hands Frank a ski mask. He gives her a curious look. Tonight we all play a game. Whoever steals the most car emblems wins. Frank smirks. Win what? She approaches Frank and whispers, whatever the winner wants. Frank quickly puts on his ski mask and rushes into the snow-covered streets of Ormond searching for cars."
MEMORY 474,Tome03_Legion,More than love. More than passion. Julie feels Frank is her spiritual twin. She spent the whole night confiding her darkest desires to him. How she often wondered what it would be like to set fire to the entire town. Frank leans forward and tell her she can do anything she wants. She just has to know what she wants and build an image of herself doing what she wants in her mind. He continues to espouse some weed-induced theory about manipulating the world with thoughts and feelings. The clearer you are about what you want and the more focused you are in imagining it the faster you rewire the world to your favor. Everyone stares at Frank for a long dramatic moment. Then they burst out laughing in unison. Let's all just imagine buckets of money. Franks shakes his head. Money is dead on its own. Money doesn't inspire the world. Real passion and emotion does. See yourself doing what it is you want to do for the rest of your life with passion. Be clear and focused and do not waver and watch the world work in your favor. Another silence. Julie smirks. Frank nods seriously. She closes her eyes and imagines herself and her friends turning Ormond into their personal play pen. She opens her eyes.
MEMORY 475,Tome03_Legion,"Julie and Frank wait for Joey and Susie at the old abandoned cabin. Of course, it had to be the cabin, the only exciting place in Ormond. Julie looks at the place. It needs some love. Joey and Susie are out messing with the sheep of Ormond as usual. They soon enter with a bunch of stop signs and laugh about the accidents they caused. No one dead but some serious injuries. Six to be precise. They snapped some pictures to capture the moment. Joey then tells them he got a new job at the local hardware store. They all make bets on how long he'll keep this job. Julie appraises the space and has an idea. She'll decorate the walls with the emblems they pulled off the cars of Ormond. Everyone likes the idea. Joey adds he wants to put hang the stop signs on the wall. Inspired by the small traffic accidents Joey and Susie engineered, Julie suggests another name for their little gang. The Marauders of Mayhem. Frank shakes his head and his eyebrows frown. Too tough on the tongue. Joey disagrees. I love it. All eyes turn to Susie. She shrugs. I agree with Frank… it's a mouthful."
MEMORY 476,Tome03_Legion,Julie and Susie enter the hardware store. Joey wants them to be quick. The owner will be back in ten minutes. Frank tells him to stop panicking. They grab supplies for the cabin. Paint. Brushes. Masks. A snow globe captures Frank's eyes. Joey tells him to leave it. Says it's his boss's collector globe. The first snow globe for tourists when Ormond became a popular getaway for snowboarders and skiers. Frank scoffs and takes the globe anyway. Julie stares at Joey and shrugs. Whatever. The globe gives her an idea. She grabs a few generic Ormond globes for a personal project.
MEMORY 477,Tome03_Legion,"The cabin is almost ready. Some finishing touches required, and Frank and Susie are hitting a few homes for supplies. Toasters. Pans. Cutlery. TV. Computer. Linen. Anything to make their refuge a little cozier. Julie stays behind refashioning generic Ormond globes with scenes of mayhem. Frank approaches her. Can I have one of those? She hands her a globe with four stick figures setting a snowman on fire. He says it should be a real person. Julie feels offended. He didn't see the detail. It is. Frank scrutinizes the globe and sees a stickman embedded in the fake snow. Nice."
MEMORY 478,Tome03_Legion,"Julie imagines something crazy. In her mind's eye she imagines herself killing someone with her friends. She has no other image and no doubt. It's more than an image of a first kill… it's an image of her in a newspaper clipping. She makes Ormond exciting again with a series of murders. Her phone startles her. She answers. She hears his voice and Frank tells her to meet him at the Ormond Majestic Theatre. Why? What's playing? He doesn't answer. She gets in her second-hand sedan and drives through the blinding snowstorm to the Theatre. He graciously opens the door. Helps her out. Joey and Suzy are standing by the theatre holding empty gas containers. Frank hands her a match. Please… Do the honors. She strikes the match. Watches the flame ignite strong then it dwindles in the cold wind. Before it extinguishes, she flicks the burning match at the theatre. A moment later a massive fire erupts in the blinding snow. She stares at Frank. At the fire. At Joey and Susie. And she has this sudden crazy thought that Frank is right. Somehow the world is conspiring in her favor."
MEMORY 479,Tome03_Legion,Joey paces the cabin suggesting names for the group. Susie thinks they need some kind of a costume like superheroes. Julie laughs. We trying to be famous? Frank shrugs. Why not? Julie shrugs. No one ever got famous with petty theft and arson. Maybe we should do something real. Frank leans forward. What does that mean? Something real? Julie goes quiet for a moment. She's not sure what she's thinking or if she's thinking at all but… she wants to feel the thrill she's read about in books. She wants to be more than common. More than ordinary. Bigger than life. Frank smiles at her and asks if she thinks she could kill someone. She thinks for a moment. I could. Frank raises a skeptical eyebrow. After a moment he says he probably couldn't really kill someone. Julie teases him. Not even for me? He shakes his head. Not even for you. And you? Would you kill for me? She echoes his bullshit answer. Never. He laughs and echoes her. Not even for me? Not even for you.
ARCUS 2903,Tome03_Observer,"I rose early to experience a few deaths in the archives I recently captured from the Rift. I had some milk from Terra 728. I listened to a radio show from Terra 232. Horror stories and tales of terror. I read a new version of Dante's Inferno from… I not sure where… I thought of home, had some whiskey and slept for what felt like an eternity."
ARCUS 7294,Tome03_Observer,"I woke up soaked in blood with no recollection of what transpired the night before. The blood dripped off my nose and chin. I felt my forehead and scalp to discover a deep, stinging gash. Accident? Self-inflicted? Nightmares of the fog? Creatures of the abyss? I didn't know. Later by the bed I discovered a purple mound of flesh and gore. I cleaned the slop and tossed it out the window into the abyss from which it had come."
ARCUS 437,Tome03_Observer,"I'm going to have a couple shots of whiskey from Terra 917, experience a few memories, then head to bed. The warmth of spirits from 917 have always had a way of lulling me away. While it is true this is a cruel fate… an even crueler fate would have been to have been imprisoned here without the Auris… without the ability to manifest and create and enjoy. It feels strange as this may seem as the nexus of creation… able to travel memories and cull from those memories without restraint. Helps pass the time. Definitely helps pass the time."
ARCUS 8875,Tome03_Observer,"It's always entertaining to watch a survivor try to escape with a femoral artery lacerated. Some victims actually get quite far before shock and cardiac arrest overwhelm them. They fight and struggle for life as if death were final. Perhaps this is the reason The Entity wipes the slate clean with every resurrection. The unwavering belief that death is real gives weight and gravitas to the trial… to the experience. Otherwise survivors won't care. Wouldn't run. Wouldn't feel. The fear of death is the pulse of life and believing death is real gives emotion to the experience. It, in other words, feeds The Entity."
ARCUS 1118,Tome03_Observer,There's nothing like silence to drive you mad. I stared out into the endless ocean of black fog surrounding me and quickly realized how incredibly small and insignificant we are. Dread and despair soon overtook me and I began to realize how arrogant we were back home to try to define and describe these living cosmic entities. We thought we had figured most out. We barely scratched the surface.
ARCUS 182,Tome03_Observer,I have discovered structures within the realms of The Entity that remind me of home. It is possible others from Terra Primus have found themselves marooned within the Entity. These survivors could have with them knowledge to free me from this tower and possibly ideas on how to escape this infernal dimension. As far as I know… we were one of the first of the many worlds to begin unraveling these great cosmic mysteries and proving that planets and solar systems were… well… alive. These discoveries led to entire paradigm shifts that unlocked for us our ability to travel from dimension to dimension. Where once we thought our knowledge was absolute… these discoveries showed us how little we actually knew about the world.
ARCUS 789,Tome03_Observer,"Emotion. Passion. Interest. They are the spark, the undefinable force that enables creation. You cannot manifest anything if you are not filled with emotion about it. The Auris was ridiculed because the council lacked understanding. This might be the whiskey ruminating but… art is not created by thought alone but by thought and feeling working in harmony. Feeling is everything… Feeling is the most important aspect of bringing anything to life. It is the fuel that makes thought and intention reality."
ARCUS 968,Tome03_Observer,"Strange, luminous markings left in the trials for survivors and killers that help me navigate and study rifts with greater ease. Someone is trying to reach out to me. Tampering with The Entity. Using tricks to secure my attention. To let me know I'm not alone. To let me know I'm not the only one able to manifest within The Entity. Yet the knowledge of living dimensions and Ancients is knowledge few have developed amongst the infinite terra worlds within the known galaxies."
ARCUS 571,Tome03_Observer,"Gut wrenching shrieks echoing through the fog disturbed my sleep. I woke up, put on some slacks, clambered to the roof with some whiskey and hit golf balls into the abyss. There's something about hitting iron and wood into oblivion that's calming, even therapeutic. I must have hit a thousand golf balls before the yelling and screaming finally subsided and I called it a night."
ARCUS 572,Tome03_Observer,"Someone left a bucket of golf balls at my door with a note: Best Balls Ever! Upon further inspection I realized they were hardened eyeballs. Fossilized eyeballs collected no doubt throughout the lost realms. I didn't realize eyeballs could be fossilized or that they make, dare I say, decent golf balls. I actually wouldn't mind another bucket. This must be a gift from my mysterious friend."
ARCUS 129,Tome03_Secrets,A knock at the door and an invitation attached to a bottle of whiskey waiting for me at the foot of the door. I kneeled to inspect the invitation. You are cordially invited to The Entity's Birthday. The Entity has a birthday? Am I losing my mind… my grip on reality… whatever that actually means here… Is this some kind of a prank by a marooned soul
ARCUS 1256,Tome03_Secrets,Discovered new memories of Evan which shed some light on his descent. The question I am asking myself is did The Entity begin to corrupt him before he was snatched for the trials or was all that anger and bloodlust a result of his harsh upbringing. Either way I would not expect him to comply with another authority figure even if that figure was an Old One.
ARCUS 723,Tome03_Secrets,"I pity Dwight. It's as though every action he takes brings the opposite of what he intends. Trying to help his fellow employees from an abuser he ends up shutting down the entire operation, leaving many in a far worse situation than they ever were in. Granted, spiking a narcissist's drink and watching him unravel was worth the price of admission. The many memories of survivors struggling with narcissists have led me to the conclusion that there are only three possibilities when relating to a narcissist. Enable them. Run away from them. Or… destroy them. But beware, narcissists take everyone with them when they go down."
MEMORY 2478,Tome04_Ace,"Ace rushes into Uh, Ohs sports bar still pumped with the excitement of the mixed martial art title defense he just watched. Female lightweight MMA champion Mika James knocked the challenger out in the first round and now he’s ready for another thrill. He sits with his buddy Wallace. Did I miss anything? Wallace shakes his head. Nah…They’re preparing the bowl now. Ace laughs out loud. Hilarious. The guy’s going to try to swallow a bowl of slugs. Only at Uh, Ohs would they hold such a ridiculous bet. Wallace nudges Ace and levels a wager. Ten to one he pukes it out. Ace looks at the idiot and the bowl of living slugs in front of him. His instincts tell him this guy’s actually going to do it. Ace just cleaned Wallace at the MMA fight and he doesn’t mind taking more of his money. Ace scrutinizes the idiot just to make sure his gut isn’t leading him astray. Most people would puke trying to swallow the first slug. But not this guy. This guy knows what he’s doing. He’s a winning horse. A sure thing. All right… let’s say double our last bet.<br><br>Wallace nods and assures him he’s going to lose. Ace smirks. We’ll see about that. As he stares beyond the idiot preparing to swallow slugs, he’s amazed to see Mika James at the bar in her signature tracksuit. They exchange a look. He points at his fan shirt and extends a thumbs-up for a great title defense, but she looks past him as she nurses a beer. Wallace sees Mika and nudges Ace. She could kick your ass in two licks. Ace scoffs. That’s a bet you would lose, asshole. I’m double her size and strength. Wallace snickers. I say you don’t last ten minutes… nah… you don’t even last five minutes. Wallace is talking shit just to talk shit. Before Ace can respond, a bell sounds and everyone goes silent as the idiot lifts the bowl of thick, moist slugs to his trembling lips. Ace stops breathing, narrows his gaze, pulls out his lucky alligator tooth, holds it in his fist, and just knows he’s got a winner. In a few short minutes he’ll be laughing all the way to the bank. Come on, idiot…swallow those slugs."
MEMORY 2479,Tome04_Ace,"Ace doesn’t understand what happened. He had Wallace dead to rights. His winning horse confidently slurped down the slugs one at a time as though he were enjoying a bowl of fresh sushi. Then he stops with the last one dangling out of his mouth… cocky little shit… He smiles and swallows… but the damn slug doesn’t go down… not as he planned. Ace can see a lump oozing and squirming down his throat. It slithers down… but it must have tickled his gag reflex or something… because he instantly loses his smile. There’s a silence. The idiot begins to squirm uncomfortably in his seat. The crowd goes… Uhh-ohh… and all of a sudden… a projectile of slug-chum shoots out his mouth and Ace hangs his head realizing he just lost everything.<br><br>Wallace laughs out loud and slaps his back. Told you so. Ace doesn’t say anything. Tell you what… double or nothing if you last five minutes with Mika James. Ace stares up at Wallace. What’s in it for you? Wallace narrows his gaze. Your lucky alligator’s tooth. Ace hesitates. Wallace smiles. What? Thought you were double her size and stronger? Ace looks at Mika, at Wallace, at Mika again and nods. I’ll knock her out in two minutes and then buy her a drink. Wallace smiles, stands, and heads over to the manager of the club to make the arrangements. Ace stands and figures he may as well introduce himself to the champ."
MEMORY 2480,Tome04_Ace,"What the hell was I thinking? Ace staggers to his wobbly feet. Oh yeah… I wasn’t! Mika steps toward him. He throws a desperate right. She ducks with a grin. He follows with a left. She sidesteps and he sees black and a few stars fading in and out of existence. What the hell did she hit me with? He doesn’t know. All he knows is he’s on his ass again and his eyelids feel like cement. He forces them open and stares up at the timer. Thirty-Seconds. How can that just be thirty-seconds! Either the timer is rigged or time itself has slowed down to an impossible crawl. Shit! I’m in trouble but I ain’t losing my lucky gator’s tooth! He doesn’t know much right now but he knows Mika’s got him outclassed in every way except guts and luck. Ace stands on wobbly legs and smiles at one of the dozen Mika’s swirling around him. He regards a dozen clocks, narrows his gaze, and calculates. Four more minutes… I can do this…"
MEMORY 2481,Tome04_Ace,The crowd is hollering and jeering. Fight! Fight! Fight! Ace stares at the timer and is relieved to pass the two-minute mark. Only three minutes to go. He just wants to last and has completely given up on the idea of knocking Mika out. He’ll be happy if he can land just once punch. He thinks he might need to grab her hair and punch below the belt just to get her to back off. But she moves faster than his eyes can track and he’s convinced his feet are turning to spaghetti. She stares at him like a hungry tiger and throws a roundhouse kick. He ducks. Laughs just as he feels her hands knit over his head and her wicked knee in his face. Black fills his vision. A moment later he’s on the ground swirling in a pool of stars with the crowd giving him a count in unison. He’s up at five with a fat lip and a pathetic smile.
MEMORY 2482,Tome04_Ace,"Minutes don’t feel like minutes. They feel like hours… days… Three minutes and Ace wants to throw in the towel, but his pride won’t let him. His common sense is telling him to quit before she breaks another rib. He gets the sense he won’t be laughing to the bank but to the hospital. But he can’t give up. He won’t give up, and he certainly won’t lose this bet. He’s going to win even if winning kills him. For a moment he half-remembers a quote about sitting on a stove with a pretty girl or a pretty girl cooking at the stove or something about a pretty girl and a stove. He’s getting it all wrong, but he knows it has something to do with time. Mika smashes a fist straight into his puffy face and he staggers back and nearly buckles over. He manages to keep his balance and tries to smile but just as soon as his lips part he somehow finds himself on the hard floor staring at a crowd that seems miles away, laughing as they give him a count in unison. He rolls on his belly and pushes himself up, groggy, and spaghetti kneed. It’s going to take a lot more than that to keep me down."
MEMORY 2483,Tome04_Ace,"Two rights in a nose that’s already broken. She clearly doesn’t want to lose. She wants to knock him out but that won’t happen. Ace won’t let it happen. Outclassed in every way except guts, he clambers to his feet. He tries to smile at her. That didn’t hurt. But it did. It really did. Before his smile breaks he finds himself in a headlock. Shit, she’s fast! Mika twirls him around like a sack of potatoes and thrusts him into a table. The table breaks. So does something in his chest. He thinks it’s a rib, but he didn’t think he had any more that could be broken. He gets up, manages a grin, and charges her. Grabs her rock-hard arms. Pins her to the wall. A surge of adrenalin fills his entire being. He’s got her now. He shoots his fist out at her face. She drops to the side, and he shatters his hand against the stone wall as he feels her lift him off the ground. A moment later she twirls and throws him into the crowd with his broken hand swelling and throbbing with every heartbeat. The crowd scatters and lets him fall hard on the ground. Something cracks. He hopes it’s not a bone. Everything is distorted. He feels like he’s underwater listening to a muted crowd hollering for him to get back up or stay down. He can’t quite tell anymore. He stands and stares at the timer, feels a sharp pain in his mouth and senses an awkward gap. My tooth! My fuckin tooth! He looks around the floor and sees his front tooth lying in a glop of blood and saliva. It’s still attached to the roots. He glances over the amused and entertained crowd and finds Wallace looking pale and frightened as Mika suddenly cuts through him like chafe."
MEMORY 2484,Tome04_Ace,"Ace dives under a table for refuge as Mika grabs him by the ankle and pulls him out. She lifts him over her head, twirls him and breaks him against another table. He stands, turns to face her, shakes his head until he clears his vision. He lurches and throws a left at one of the three faces he sees. Mika ducks and delivers a slashing right hook to the body then drops him with a devastating right hook. He rolls over the ground, wheezing, feeling his jarred and jutting ribs. He probably should be dead. He doesn’t even want to think about the hospital bill. Hospital? He doesn’t need a hospital. He hasn’t seen a doctor in ten years and certainly doesn’t need one now. His body can heal on its own. He pushes himself up but doesn’t feel much below the waist. He shoots a weak punch with his good hand. Mika grabs his fist mid-air and crushes his fingers into a mangled mush. Mercilessly she grabs his arm and… pops his elbow. He screams with blood gurgling out of his mouth. She wants him down even if it means killing him.<br><br>Ace suddenly realizes… Mika made her own bet. His entire body floods with endorphins as he wobbles around Uh, Ohs spinning floor. A glance at the timer reveals he’s only got twenty seconds left. He’s going to win even if he loses every bone in his body. What more can this kitten do to me? He clambers back to his feet and smiles with blood gushing out of his mouth. She charges him like a wildcat and is a whirlwind of devastating blows. He’s hit a dozen times and flattened with a wicked uppercut. The crowd is screaming and hollering for Mika to lay him out for good. But Ace won’t lose his gator tooth even if it cost him his real tooth.<br><br>Seconds pass like minutes. The bell sounds. It’s over. It’s finally over. Ace collapses. Wallace stares down at him with a newfound respect and a wad of cash in his hands. Ace stares at the money and manages to mumble something. You bastard… you bet on me? Wallace pulls Ace up and hands him his tooth. Put this in your mouth to keep the nerves moist. Keep them there until we reach the hospital. That’s one for the books, buddy. Ace shakes his head. I’m good… don’t need a doctor. Wallace laughs incredulously. Dude… you need a doctor, a dentist, and fuckin shrink."
MEMORY 1702,Tome04_Hag,"Don’t play with powers you don’t understand. Lisa’s grandmother scolds her for scratching a symbol into her textbook for good luck. Lisa apologizes for snooping through her things. She just wanted to know more about the old village-town and the stories of witches and cannibals that were burned alive or chased out. She heard her mother say her grandmother had come across several books written in an unknown language with strange symbols. Her grandmother warns her to stay away from her books. You can attract great misfortune to yourself and others. Lisa wants to laugh but doesn’t. She was just messing around and doesn’t really believe in all this superstitious nonsense. No such thing as witches and cannibals, Gran. I was just hoping for a little luck on my algebra test. No harm, no foul. Her grandmother tells her the symbol she sketched was the very one she had used long ago to turn a cannibal into a gnarled, twisted, swamp tree covered in putrid, black ooze. It’s so ridiculous Lisa wants to burst out laughing but she contains herself as she listens to her tale of cannibals and missing children. When her grandmother finishes her story, Lisa hugs her and kisses her soft, wrinkled forehead. Don’t worry, Gran… I’m not going to turn into a swamp-tree or be kidnapped by a bunch of cannibals."
MEMORY 1703,Tome04_Hag,"Lisa doesn’t know if it’s the symbols on her book or some kind of placebo effect… but her math scores are improving. Not as much as they should be, but still…she’s passing and passing is an improvement. Her friend Pam says it’s all malarkey. There’s no such thing as lucky symbols that can raise your grade. It’s all smoke and mirrors. Unfounded, ancient superstition. Jokingly Pam says she wants better marks, too. She grabs Lisa’s textbook and copies the symbol in her school agenda several times. Lisa feels a tug in her gut, and she stares at the symbols with concern. You really shouldn’t do that. She yanks her textbook back from Pam. You shouldn’t mess with powers you don’t understand. Pam laughs. What’s the problem, Lisa? If these things can help you pass math, they can help me pass English, too. No big deal."
MEMORY 1704,Tome04_Hag,"Pam begs for another symbol or charm to help her on a test she isn’t ready for with a teacher she despises. A teacher she ridicules for being an overweight, pill-popping bore. Lisa refuses to entertain the idea and tells her she’s not allowed to look at her grandmother’s secret book let alone share its contents with strangers. Pam shrugs and proceeds to scratch a symbol on her arm with a toothpick. She asks if Lisa heard what happened to the woman near the school. Lisa shakes her head. Pam laughs as she draws blood with the toothpick. Dumb ass walked into the street while reading and splat! Crushed by a truck! Come! She flicks the toothpick to the ground, grabs Lisa’s wrist and leads her to a road a few blocks from the school. Lisa covers her nose and can smell the fermenting human fluids in the cracks of the pavement. Pam points out blood stains and clumps of hair in the road and makes jokes at the dead girl’s expense. Lisa grabs her wrist angrily. You mustn’t laugh at the dead. Pam yanks her wrist away. Stop being creepy, Lisa. It’s not like she’s still around to get offended… besides… your symbols got me covered with all kinds of luck. Lisa stares at Pam’s arm with concern and hopes the dead girl’s spirit didn’t take offense. Her grandmother says sometimes spirits linger, especially when they don’t want to be dead. Last thing she needs is some dark force following her for the rest of her life."
MEMORY 1705,Tome04_Hag,"Pam’s English teacher died of unknown causes and Pam’s dancing with joy, relieved she doesn’t have to do his stupid test on some irrelevant dead author. I don’t care what English teachers say, James is unreadable and confusing--a pseudo-intellectual who kept everything vague because he didn’t actually know what the hell he was talking about. Lisa shrugs, disagrees, but doesn’t want to get into it with her friend—her annoying friend. She likes his books, the way his style allows her to live in his character’s head for a little while. She finds his novel about an artist to be a fun, formless, dream-like stew with plenty of style and substance. But what does she know, she’s only sixteen, and her English marks are below average. Pam hoots and hollers, and with a mischievous smile, she reveals a hand covered with ink-smudged, symbols. Best luck in the world! No test! No lard ass! No dead authors for the rest of the year! Thanks, Lisa! Lisa stares at the symbols on her hand and wants to yell at her for being so careless with things they both don’t fully understand. She closes her eyes and hopes her English teacher wants to be dead and that he isn’t lurking about."
MEMORY 1706,Tome04_Hag,"The class is at the funeral out of respect for their beloved English teacher. The pallbearers struggle and strain under the weight of the coffin. Pam leans toward Lisa and whispers how lucky she is and how unlucky the poor pallbearers are to have to lift such a heavy coffin. Imagine having to carry that lard-ass to his grave. Lisa nudges Pam and tells her to quit it. As the pallbearers approach them she feels a sudden tug in her gut. An instinct tells her to take some distance from her friend. An image of lightning striking Pam flashes through her mind. She wonders if an angry spirit could make that happen. Every muscle, organ, vessel, fried in an instant for her hubris. Pam snaps Lisa out of her thoughts with another tactless comment. Lisa hears her grandmother’s voice in her head telling her that her friend has tempted fate by laughing at someone else’s misfortune. For having laughed at the dead. She doesn’t really believe in all her grandmother’s superstitions… and yet… she inches away from her friend, staring at the darkening clouds, waiting for lightning to strike Pam down."
MEMORY 548,Tome04_Meg,"Slash tires? Sounds a bit extreme. Meg regrets showing Coach Jenny how fast she could run during Phys Ed class. She saw something she liked, asked Meg to run, and now she wants her to race at the State Championships. From a virtual nobody to glorified jock almost overnight. New friends, bitter rivals and rumors abound. Why Meg? Why does she get a free ticket? She never practiced, sucked up, or took diet pills to keep her weight in check. Why her? What makes her so special? The idea of a free ticket makes Meg laugh. No free ticket for her. She’s always loved to run, just not in an organized way, and she’s quite certain she put more hours into her passion than anyone else on the team.<br><br>The team dresses Meg up in bandit costume with black and white stripes like a criminal in a silent film. It’s so stupid she wants to scream. Two team members argue over the costume and finally decide on dropping the cliché bandit look for a more contemporary supervillain costume. They make a mask and tell her to slash tires near the police station. Then they exchange anxious looks with one another. Sounds less like initiation and more like a way to get her off the team and into a prison cell. Dana gives her a strange look, a dirty look. Seems like she has an upset stomach, gas even. She hates Meg for beating her time and probably wants to see her locked up. The rest of the team thinks up supervillain names for Meg. Street Rusher. Super Blaster. Dare Diva. Whatever. They’re all stupid. Just choose a name already."
MEMORY 549,Tome04_Meg,"Dare Damsel Meg bolts through the streets stirring up laughter and attention. She feels stupid and scared at the same time lurking about in her supervillain costume. Meg pushes down her fear, composes herself, focuses her thoughts. If they want a slashed tire, they’ll get one and more. I’ll go straight into the belly of the whale and pull out a rib. She laughs at the image. Wonders where it came from and realizes it’s from one of the stories she recently read to her mother to help her fall asleep despite her deteriorating condition. Doctors don’t know what she has, and they can’t afford the doctors anymore. Don’t let your thoughts betray you. Meg pushes her grief out of her mind as pedestrians laugh and point at her costume. I’m going to target the police and set the record of this stupid hazing ritual.<br><br>Determined, Meg approaches the Colorado police station with her heart beating at a record-breaking speed. She kneels behind a cruiser, hesitates, her hand trembles involuntarily. She’s not used to breaking the law. She takes a deep, calming breath. First time for anything. Then, with a pocketknife, she slashes a tire, yanks a piece of rubber off and backs away. Before the officers realize what’s what Meg’s a bolt of lightning. Her heart’s pounding in her throat. Her legs are a blur. The police give chase but eat her dust. She returns to the team with a piece of slashed rubber and a new team record. A police cruiser. An actual police cruiser. Beat that! The team laughs and jeers except for Dana who stares at her with her usual gas face. No one on the team has ever done anything so bold. Welcome to the team… Dare Damsel Meg."
MEMORY 550,Tome04_Meg,"Meg is the talk of the school and she likes it. Coach Jenny tells her she still needs a lot of work in the mechanics of running. She doesn’t even know what that means. She’s been running in the mountains with her mother for years and she never had to learn the ‘mechanics’ of running. Coach says for the next few practices she needs to improve her confidence on the starting line. Sure, that shouldn’t be a problem. Coach spends a lot of time with Meg and many on the team are beginning to take notice. Dana makes snide remarks in the shadows about Meg’s body being disproportional, about Meg having beginners’ luck, about how Meg’s legs seem disproportional to her torso. Meg ignores her, refuses to dignify her jealousy by responding to it. Dana gets no reaction from Meg as she talks about how her thighs are just a bit too thick for running. Dana gives her that stupid, gas face. Meg glares at Dana with a flood of expletives she wants to unleash. You’ll eat my dust soon enough, wench! Meg suppresses her anger and smiles politely, thanking the wench for her concern, telling her she’s confident her so-called disproportional body and thick thighs will prove advantageous at the championship."
MEMORY 551,Tome04_Meg,"Meg begins her long walk home after an exhausting yet exhilarating practice. She holds her lucky piece of tire in her hand though she doesn’t really believe in luck. She hears her mom’s voice rattle in her brain. The only luck you get is the luck you make. And yet… the piece of tire kind of looks like a horseshoe. Coincidence? Probably. She admires her lucky slice of tire and starts when she hears a twig snap behind her. Before she realizes what’s happening, she’s thrust to the ground by a shadowy figure who stomps on her ankle. Terrible pain shoots up her spine and she screams for help as the shadow bolts away. Meg screams in agony as she desperately scrambles to her feet. As soon as her wounded foot touches the ground another sharp pain rushes through her like wildfire and she collapses. She closes her eyes, gathers herself, suppresses her pain and reaches around for something, anything, to support her weight. A moment later she grabs a thick, gnarled, branch and shrieks as she forces herself to stand. Every step home is like a hammer smashing at her ankle."
MEMORY 552,Tome04_Meg,"The doctor tells Meg her foot is fractured in several places and she should probably stay off it until it heals. She shambles out of the office on crutches with her mother by her side. Meg can sense she’s worried about her and how she’s to settle the bill without insurance. They drive home in silence. Mom… I’m sorry. Meg breaks the silence. Her mother shakes her head. Don’t apologize, Meg. No need for that, I’m just glad you’re okay… Could have been a lot worse. Meg nods and replays the assault over and over again in her mind. The push. The kick. The stomping. Nothing about what happened makes sense. The perpetrator didn’t mug or try to steal anything from her. Meg’s mother breaks the silence and asks if she remembers anything about the man since they spoke to the police. Meg shakes her head. I’m not even sure it was a man."
MEMORY 553,Tome04_Meg,"Meg confides in her mother at the kitchen table. She’s convinced Dana arranged for someone to wound her to discourage her from running. Anger overwhelms her and she says things she wouldn’t normally say. I want her dead. I want to crush her like a bug. I want her to burn in fucking hell. I would have won that race! Her mother listens to her without judgment and waits for her to calm down. You’re very upset and I understand, but don’t… don’t stoop to her level, don’t let her turn you into what you’re not. You want revenge? Best revenge is success. Let her know you’re the best even at your worst and that will be her worst frecking hell. Meg narrows her eyes on her mother. Her mother squeezes her hand. If you think you’re beaten, you are. If you think you can’t, you can’t. Life’s battles aren’t won with speed and strength, but mind and will. Tears fill Meg’s eyes. Not because of her mother’s advice… but because she knows her mother’s days are numbered… and this probably one of their last be-positive, pep talks.<br><br>Her mother hands over a box she pulls from under the table. Meg lifts the lid to reveal a black dress unlike anything she’s ever seen or worn. Before she can say anything her mother laughs. Not only will you win, but you’ll be the jewel of the afterparty. Meg feels a lump growing in her throat. Don’t lose all your strength focusing on the negative. Her mother used to be a competitive tennis player. All Meg heard growing up was stories about Billie Jean King. Meg waits for the ‘listen-to-win’ pep talk she’s heard so many times she’s lost count. Her mother relates how she would listen to a radio broadcast of King’s game to steer her mind away from fear and negativity. Fill your brain with success so there’s no room for fear. She’s prepared a special mix for Meg on her pod. Meg takes the pod and stares at it a moment, a long moment. Then she leaps across the table and embraces her mother and never wants to let go."
MEMORY 554,Tome04_Meg,"Meg listens to a radio broadcast as she enters school. Fastest runner ever. The Buckeye-Bullet taking the gold at the Olympics despite every mental and physical obstacle leveled against him. She listens to the same broadcast over and over again. Fill your head with win so there’s no room for fear or doubt. Coach approaches Meg as she puts her pod down beside her. I heard a nasty rumor that Dana may have had something to do with your leg, and I’ve decided to pull her from the race. Meg shakes her head. Please, don’t do that… I’m going to beat her, coach, and I’m going to win. Coach’s eyes widen. You’re going to do what? You didn’t just say you’re going to win? You’re not actually thinking of running on that foot. Meg hesitates, then lies. Doctor says it’s fine and that it’s just a little bruised. Coach touches the foot, Meg shrieks. She gives Meg a skeptical look, sighs, says nothing else and leaves. Dare Damsel Meg grabs her pod, raises the volume of the broadcast and fills her mind with greatness as The Buckeye-Bullet makes The Dictator eat his dust."
ARCUS 984,Tome04_Observer,"More luminous energy sent to me by an unknown ally. With this energy I was able to open a small window that allowed me to look into a lost realm where I saw to my great surprise a city with survivors living as though nothing was out of the ordinary. The window eventually closed, and I spent the entire evening imagining how such a thing could be possible or if it was merely an illusion. The same night another surge of energy permitted me to open a doorway into a realm I didn’t much recognize or dare explore. I stared at the scintillating doorway until it faded out of existence. It’s as though the one manifesting these sacred glyphs is trying to help me delve deeper into the mysteries of this dimension or, perhaps, he is suggesting that the answers to my salvation are hidden amongst the countless realms discarded by this Old One since time immemorial."
ARCUS 985,Tome04_Observer,"Instead of reading aloud in my usual way, I clambered to the roof of my tower and conjured a fire and a radio to listen to some ghost stories from a half-remembered radio serial from Terra Dark. Without a doubt listening to these stories has proven to be the best way to pass the time especially when you’ve got endless voices clattering in your head, bringing you down with their endless agonies and anxieties. Later I used the Auris to manifest The Storyteller to read his stories like he had done for his weekly podcast. He was composed of ever-moving, black fog, and I suspect that one day I’ll actually be able to recreate a more realistic person to listen to or perhaps even engage with in something that resembles a conversation. Listening to The Storyteller and hearing familiar expressions I am wondering: how do I keep myself out of my own creations? The memories I attempt to record as fast as I experience them prove one thing to me. They show me objectivity is impossible, or elusive at best, and I’m never quite sure if my logs are a true and accurate depiction of the subject’s memory or a whiskey laden interpretation of a nightmare. To add to my frustrations, I have recently noticed other voices have made their way into my notes. Other interpretations. Other thought-patterns from people whose memories I’ve likely spent too much time reliving. They are becoming a part of me and that wasn’t supposed to happen."
ARCUS 986,Tome04_Observer,"The Storyteller kept me entertained throughout the night with his gory tales of Nosferatu so that I almost forgot my own personal living, nightmare. His stories entertain and make for a perfect distraction when smashing golf balls into the abyss just won’t suffice. There have been countless tales of vampires, and to be certain I’ve read most of them, but to my mind… his are the most chilling. More than once now I’ve woken in a cold sweat with the sense that my tower has been overrun by these horrible creatures with fangs for teeth."
ARCUS 987,Tome04_Observer,"Another incident woke me in the middle of the night. An incredible surge of energy coming to me from an undetermined source. At first, I thought my mind had given way to illusions and wild imaginings until I realized the energy surging through my tower was widening yet another doorway into a lost realm composed of memories from an unremembered civilization lost to time. I approached and stared into the remnants of a war-torn, abandoned city with the eerie cry of a baby echoing in the distance. Just as I made to enter the lost realm the scintillating doorway shrunk and sizzled out of existence. I soon realized it may very well be possible to explore this Old One from my tower with the help of this unique energy and the Auris."
ARCUS 5736,Tome04_Observer,"I have seen into the heart of this Old One and have seen things no mortal eyes should see… things that simultaneously perplex my mind and burden my conscience. With mysterious help I have ripped open reality, searched deep within countless rifts and seen everything tumble helplessly toward chaos and entropy… toward death and madness… and for the briefest moment I had the ridiculous thought that the mysterious ally helping me could very well be The Entity playing it’s game with me, toying with me as a cat does a mouse before the claw rips the tiny jugular out. Staring out into the endless abyss of black fog I thought that this prison could very well be another form of trial disguised and designed to feast on all the psychic energies derived from alienation, boredom and all those bouts of unremembered insanity. I can’t help but feel millions of invisible hooks in my heart and millions of unseen eyes all around me… watching me… waiting for me to tumble toward chaos and madness like everything else… waiting for my mind to turn against itself. This bastard of an Old One wants me to kill myself. I am sure of it. Or maybe… Maybe I already have, and maybe I will again… and again… and again…"
MEMORY 656,Tome04_Wraith,"The boy holds his lucky bell and stares out into the growing dusk. Night is coming and with it the promise of monsters worse than anything his father has ever described in his campfire stories. Rumors of endless massacres terrify him, and he hopes his mother and father will soon return. They heard a radio broadcast promising safety to those hiding and they left with others to investigate. He spent the whole day staring at the dirt road leading out of the village waiting for them to return. A few returned with wounds and horror stories. Endless stories of death, destruction and mayhem. He didn’t understand any of them. They hate us. Why? Why do they hate us? Because the radio and the television tell them to. What did I ever do to them? You were born in newly created Nigeria, that’s what you did. You were born a Northerner. His grandmother approaches. Did you see anything out there? Philip shakes his head. If you see anything… if you see danger… ring your father’s bell and hide with the others. Philip nods and stares at the bell. Will they come back? His grandmother hesitates for a long moment. I don’t… I don’t think so, Philip. They’re hiding. Tears fill his eyes as his grandmother disappears into a small thatched home. He feels a tear slip down his face, and he knows, just knows… he will never see his parents again."
MEMORY 665,Tome04_Wraith,"Philip enters another decimated village under the cover of darkness and sees a crew… A killing crew. Maybe the very ones who killed his guardian. Maybe the very ones who killed his grandmother… his parents. No hell is good enough for these demons who would take money to disappear people. They’re cooking something by a fire, laughing, and making jokes at the expense of those they butchered. They talk about his people as though they were animals. No. Less than animals. No one takes pride or ridicules the animals they slaughter. He’s never seen anything like it. Dogs without humanity, that’s what they are, dogs, rabid dogs, nothing less, nothing more. Something ancient tugs at him. He feels darkness like a tendril from another world take hold of his young, innocent heart. Not young or innocent, anymore. He hears Funanya’s voice. Forgive, and be forgiven.<br><br>But he doesn’t want to forgive and he doesn’t want to be forgiven. He wants them to suffer like they made his people suffer. He wants them to suffer for taking everything from him. He hears his grandmother’s voice trying to distract him from his dark thoughts of revenge with infinite math problems. But over her voice is the raging, maddening heartbeat of his hate. Her voice screams out equations and challenges. But he glares at the men. He feels kerosene coursing through his veins and he’s ready to explode. An eye for an eye and the whole world plunges into infinite night. Good.<br><br>Philip notices the guns by the jeep. He could grab one and shoot them all. But he’s never used a gun and they’d probably run away. He could find a knife or machete… but these dogs would overpower him… Just walk away, Philip. Never look back. It’s your duty to survive and bear witness. He ignores the voices in his head and only wants one thing. He wants them to suffer and disappear. He wants to… yes… take their kerosene and make them disappear the same way they made his friends and family disappear--in a swirl of smoke. And for a moment… just a moment… he is the angel of death swooping through infinite night."
MEMORY 657,Tome04_Wraith,"Grandmother Abigail hasn’t smiled for days. A terrible smell of rotting flesh drifts into their village and she tells Philip it’s the stench of decomposing cows. Philip nods, but knows she’s just trying to protect him from the truth. He heard the elders talking by the well. So many dead and… they are burning the bodies before there is an investigation. Who is burning the bodies? Killing crews… Human butchers. Men paid to make his people disappear as though they were an infestation of cockroaches. A deal with the devil for money. He hates them all and tries to sleep but can’t. All he can do is stare at the door where he hopes against hope to see his parents again. But he knows… they’re never returning and all he has left is Grandmother Abi.<br><br>Abi approaches him and lies beside him. He leans his head against her and closes his eyes and cries. He hears her open her mouth to say something… but no words come out. He opens his eyes and she’s crying silently. Before he can say anything, a bell rings, her face grows hard as she grabs him by the wrist and leads him outside to a hatch. A moment later they’re underground with the muted sounds of slaughter vibrating through the ground. He squirms in Abi’s embrace. She holds him tighter and tighter as cries and shrieks swell into an unbearable pandemonium. He never realized humans could emit such sounds and it’s all he can do not to scream himself. He squirms and Abi covers his mouth just in case."
MEMORY 658,Tome04_Wraith,"Silence. Horrible, gut-wrenching silence. Philip shifts uncomfortably in their make-shift bunker and listens for something… anything. Abi nudges him. Let’s see your math skills, Philip. Math? She’s trying to distract him from the hell outside. Six plus twenty-four minus eight. He works it out. Twenty-two. She smiles and nods. She levels another challenge and another. He answers with growing tears in his eyes. She touches his face. Don’t think about what is happening outside… listen to my words and play the game. He nods and tries his best to work out her challenges… but he can’t help but think about his mother… his father… They said math would strengthen his brain. Make him good in school. Give him all kinds of opportunities his father never had. His father… he’ll never do math with him again… never play chess with him again… or hear his stories… and why? Because of men who take money to do the devil’s work.<br><br>Abi nudges him. Philip asks her to repeat the challenge just as the cry of a toddler rips through the silence. He instantly looks to his grandmother. Her eyes go wide as she stands and approaches the ladder. Philip runs to her and grabs her hand. Don’t go… please… please… She hesitates, staring at the hatch above. I cannot leave the boy out there alone. Philip nods and wants to hold her soft, wrinkled hand forever. But he lets go and watches her as she bravely ascends the ladder and disappears into the scorching day."
MEMORY 659,Tome04_Wraith,"Hours? Days? Weeks? He’s not sure how much time has passed. His eyes never left the hatch as he repeated countless math problems in his mind to avoid facing the truth that she has disappeared with the rest of his people. He hears her voice, her laugh, her sighs. He wants to see her again. He wants to see his parents. His friends and neighbors. He wants to see them all. But he knows… his life will never be the same again and he would rather be dead than live without them. He closes his eyes and ascends into the cool night. The smell of rotting humanity instantly assaults his senses. Reminds him of roadkill left in the sun for days… only… worse… He searches the moonlight ground and soon finds his father’s bell by the charred, remains of a body. What happened? You were supposed to keep a look out? You were supposed to warn us. He takes the bell and cries out for his grandmother in a raspy whisper, but the whisper turns into an endless scream. He screams until he loses his voice, and all that answers back is the deafening silence of the cold, indifferent night. He falls to his knees, taps his bell with his finger, and wishes he could just disappear from this living nightmare."
MEMORY 660,Tome04_Wraith,"Village to village it’s always the same scene. Death and destruction. Burnt cars, homes, and bodies. His people disappearing in a seemingly endless mixture of fog and smoke. He can’t move anymore. He doesn’t have the strength or will. The smoke stings his eyes. The stench makes him want to retch with every inhale. But most of all he can’t take… the silence. The horrible silence. The oppressive, dreadful, indifferent silence. He stops and sits by a tree with a vulture hovering close to him, waiting for him to die. This one wants its meat fresh. Raw. Not burnt or doused in kerosene. He closes his eyes for a moment and drifts away, far away, but soon he hears a voice… a voice like his mother’s… he opens his eyes to see a woman and several muddied children staring at him. The mother extends an open hand. You must come with me. Philip doesn’t answer. He can’t answer. There’s no warmth or wetness in his mouth. His throat is like sand. His eyes are like tar. The woman hands him a flask, and he drinks as though he’s never had water before. She tells him her name is Funanya and that he should come with her. I don’t want to run anymore … I want to die… The mother keeps her hand extended. And that is why you must live… you must live to tell others what happened… to bear witness… Philip stares beyond the woman and fixes his gaze on one boy and two girls. He takes Funanya’s hand and together they trudge into the thick smoke and fog refusing to be disappeared."
MEMORY 661,Tome04_Wraith,"Philip enters a home that’s been ransacked by killing crews. There’s blood splatter on the wall and a dark, familiar stench. Philip doesn’t want to think about what happened to the owners. For a moment he sees his mother approaching him, but then she disappears to reveal Funanya. She approaches Philip with some salvaged school supplies. Sometimes drawing helps get you get your mind off things. Philip shakes his head. He doesn’t want to draw and he doesn’t want to do math. He doesn’t want to do anything but wake up from this terrible nightmare. He stares at the other boy… Emeka… as he draws a picture of his village. He has a dozen colors to choose from, but he only uses black. Funanya doesn’t understand why but none of the colors appeal to him… it’s as though he’s stopped seeing color. Philip stares at the picture of the colorless village and steps outside where Nikki and Chika keep watch. He shows them his father’s lucky bell, though he’s not sure it’s so lucky anymore. He hands it to Nikki, explains she should ring it if she sees anything."
MEMORY 662,Tome04_Wraith,"I hate the smell of kerosene. Funanya nods and agrees with Philip. It’s not the kerosene but everything else attached to it. Nikki looks at Funanya and asks why the crews are burning everything. Funanya doesn’t answer and maybe she doesn’t know. Philip turns to her. They are burning evidence. Nikki and Chika look to Funanya, and she nods. Philip hears his grandmother’s voice. Death plus destruction equals good business for devils disguised as humans. Philip grinds his teeth and answers the disembodied voice. They should all be killed… those who pay for murder and those who profit from murder…Funanya stares at him. Philip… don’t say such things… they are trying to take our humanity from us and that is the one thing they cannot take unless we give it to them.<br><br>Philip feels his face harden. I don’t want a sermon. I want my family back. I want them to pay for what they did. Funanya puts a hand on his shoulder. Pray to the angel of mercy that we survive so that we may bear witness. Philip stares past her at the growing night. I’d rather pray to the angel of death and watch them suffer. Forgive, and be forgiven. I can’t! I hate them! How can they take money to do such things? There will be justice, Philip. They will not get away with their crimes. Philip doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t say anything because like his father he believes that those with money, those who can afford killing crews and the quantities of kerosene required to burn humans by the thousands, can get away with any crime they choose to commit--even mass murder. She can pray for mercy all she likes. He’d rather pray for vengeance."
MEMORY 663,Tome04_Wraith,Those who profit from murder are worse than animals. He can’t get the idea out of his head that people would do such dreadful things for money. If he survives this… if he escapes this scorching hell… he’ll have his revenge. He can’t help but share his dark thoughts with Funanya who says that an eye for an eye is not the way. That an eye for an eye would make the whole world go blind and plunge us all into infinite night. The world go blind? The world is already blind to what is happening to him and his people. To hell with the world. The world doesn’t care. All this unrest and destruction was meant to happen. It was a mathematical formula to divide and conquer and rob his country of its beloved resources. He heard the elders say this a hundred times. Funanya gives him more wise words from dead leaders and he stops talking about revenge. For a moment he thinks that maybe she’s right. Maybe revenge is not the solution. Maybe the world will one day wake up from its slumbering indifference and help his people.
MEMORY 664,Tome04_Wraith,"Nikki hands Philip back his bell in the dark night. It’s his turn to watch for killing crews, but he hasn’t slept in days and his eyelids are stones. He holds his bell close to his heart and for a moment just a moment he closes his eyes. Just for one minute. He awakens in the heat of morning with a start and a terrible feeling. He vaults to his feet and searches for his new friends. He finds one… pieces of one… of another… he’s not sure. He hears someone moaning. He searches and finds… Funanya… not dead but dying… sliced at every tendon… writhing in agony… covered in something golden… honey… they poured honey over her… and a million tiny black things swim, drown, and gorge on the gold and crimson streams dripping from her open wounds.<br><br>The ants are crawling under her skin and eating her alive. He kneels beside her and tries to swap them away but it’s no use. They’re everywhere. Funanya whimpers and sputters blood as she tries to speak. But her tongue is missing and all that issues is a terrible, rattling noise. Philip kneels before her. He doesn’t know what to say or do. I fell asleep… I’m sorry… so sorry… but sorry doesn’t put her back together again. Sorry doesn’t get rid of the ants or bring back the children she was protecting. She barely scratches something with her finger in the dirt. I forgive.<br><br>Philip stares at the words for a long moment. Silent tears fall as he raises his hand in front her face. She closes her eyes and waits for her suffering to end. He doesn’t want to do it, but he has to. He knows he has to. He closes his eyes and lowers his hand over her mouth and nose, and for a moment, just a moment, he becomes her angel of mercy."
MEMORY 1752,Tome05_Blight,"In the vast desert of rubble and crumbling columns he sees a flower, a single flower. He shambles through the ruins and extends his hand into a blurring image. Stem and petals disintegrate before his touch. An illusion… He looks up and there… another flower. He rushes toward it as the ground beneath his feet shatters. Endlessly he falls through the remnants of lost and forgotten realms. He wants it to stop. He can't take the rush of hot air and the feeling of his organs rising into his mouth. He hits the ground. Ribs jut out of his chest. Jagged bones rip through his fetid skin. Where am I? What is this place? He's in a half-remembered laboratory. He sees an emblem. The Company. He remembers the wars. The Opium Wars. He remembers the prisoners and the experiments and his endless search for doorways into other realms. He found them, just not the way he thought he would. Warm blood pools around him as thousands of decaying prisoners in company fatigues grab and claw at him. This isn't happening. It can't be happening. You're dead! You're all dead! He closes his eyes. A collective roar and the prisoners lift him over their heads and toss his broken body into a lightless dungeon. Dark. Cold. Lonely. He shivers and begs… one more flower… I'll do anything… just give me one more… flower…"
MEMORY 1753,Tome05_Blight,"Power is in the mind—the eye of the mind as the mystics called it. The eye that lets us dream and visualize is more than we think it is. Much more. It is a key and it opens doors… Endless doors…. and the key is a secretion… a sacred secretion like a drug to travel within the endless worlds within the swirling chaos that is infinite life. Blasphemy! Take your ideas out of this school! They belong to the devil! He takes his ideas to The Company and says the secretion is better than opium. He tells them there is no experience like it and he calls it the Dragon's Doorway. Makes the high from the poppy seem like cough syrup. He remembers the mystics. The unknown mystics. Mystics who chant hymns in the hope they will die with the right vibration. Right vibration? What does it mean to die with the right vibration? It means they believe different vibrations open different doorways to realms unknown. Death opens the doorway… and the dragon carries you away. The Company is interested. How would you harvest such an opioid if it's only secreted upon death? I'll find a way. And he does… only they find him before he can complete his life's work. He vaguely remembers being bludgeoned to death and thrown in a mass grave of corrupting bodies. And… he remembers being saved… by nine mystics in thick, dark tunics… Where are the nine now? What have they done with my research? Why did they try to stop me? Questions… so many questions… Where is my flower… in your mind… he thrusts his fingers into his sockets and tears out his eyes and digs deep into his head… searching for a flower… one flower…"
MEMORY 1754,Tome05_Blight,"Even with no eyes he can see. It doesn't make any sense. He clambers about the muck and grime. He slips and falls and suddenly realizes he's clambering over a heap of rotting prisoners and addicts. He pushes through as the groveling men and women beg for more opioids… for tea… for syrup… for opium laced candies… they make ridiculous promises… take my house… my money… my children… take everything… give me more… just a little more… They sound like him. He pushes through a blur of faces he vaguely recollects. Lives ruined, shattered, destroyed. Wasn't his fault. He hears a disembodied voice. Kill them all and a flower you will have. He stares down at the agonizing men and women and withdraws his cane. Smashes through limbs and skulls furiously. Heads burst open like watermelons. Bones break like dry sticks. He doesn't stop until he stands atop a mountain flesh, vomit and gore. Where is it? Where's my flower? Find it. He falls to his knees and digs through the thick sludge of mangled humanity to search for a flower… finds one… but just as he touches the flower it withers away and disappears along with the remnants of his past."
MEMORY 1755,Tome05_Blight,"Talbot… my name is Talbot. He remembers his name as he stares at nine hooded figures approaching him. He stumbles over a crumbling pillar with strange symbols written in a language he half-remembers. He remembers the school, the secret school, and the mystics and the arcane knowledge they were protecting. He was getting too close and he wasn't ready. Humanity wasn't ready. Knowledge without wisdom leads to self-destruction. He doesn't care about any of that. You condemned me! You all condemned me! Left me to wither away! A hooded figure approaches him. You condemned yourself, Talbot! You condemned yourself… The nine hooded figures disappear as a massive dragon bursts through the ground and peers down at him with dead, black eyes. The hideousness of its face transcends anything he's ever read about, seen or imagined. An ancient evil quickened with dark life! Talbot trembles in a fog of madness that envelops him. The ancient beast lashes out at him, snatches him in its talons and swallows him whole. Mingled saliva and acid rips through his tunic and burns his skin to the bone. With screams of agony he slowly disintegrates in a belly full of putrid, rotting death, watching his body and limbs melt into a gory endless mass."
MEMORY 1756,Tome05_Blight,"Talbot wakens in a mass graveyard of skeletons and decaying prisoners of The Company. He blinks and shakes muck from his hollowed eyes. He vomits everything in his guts and doesn't understand what's happening to him. Nothing makes sense except for his hunger. Please… I will… do anything… give me what I ask and I am yours. Give it to me… I need it… Vines suddenly burst through the decaying bodies and surround him. Flowers grow and bloom in all their glory. Beautiful golden serum drips like honey wherever his eye can see. He approaches one slowly and is scared to touch it. He extends his hand and touches the flower and… it doesn't wither away. He touches another. And another. Nothing happens. He goes to grab the flower but instead—the flower grabs him! Vines like tentacles burst out and wrap around him and rip through his veins. Nine hooded figures approach him with disapproving looks. Knowledge without wisdom leads to self-destruction. They inch up to him. Be careful what you wish for, Talbot. Be careful what you wish for."
1 - The Night,Tome05_Halloween2018,"It is impossible to describe the horrifying scenes I have witnessed… death and misery, in every shape of terror, rule this place.<br><br>I can no longer recall how I have come to this place. All I remember is the opaque, milky fumes of opium in the murky den hazing a sweet, welcoming abyss.<br><br>I awoke to dreadful screams in this endless night, at the feet an old tree that leaked foul-smelling fluids. I know not how to reach those poor souls, nor do I want to. Keeping a record is all I can do to make sense of it."
10 - At Last,Tome05_Halloween2018,"Based on Vigo’s calculations, tonight is my last chance.<br><br>I filled a syringe with the last drops of serum and injected it into my arm."
11 - The End,Tome05_Halloween2018,I did everything right… and failed.<br><br>I am stuck in this infernal place with no serum and nowhere to hide.
12 - Vigo,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I looked for Vigo. I shouted his name with no concern for the monsters lurking about. I need to find him… I picture the scene, etching a canvas of wild lines in my mind, focusing on the moon and I know--something is off.<br><br>I fed the dead rodent under my pillow."
13 - Pray,Tome05_Halloween2018,"Soon, very soon, I will be at peace.<br><br>The cold claws of death are drawing near."
--,Tome05_Halloween2018,It’s here.<br><br>The Entity is here.<br><br>It has found me.
2 - Vigo,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I&nbsp;discovered&nbsp;a&nbsp;hidden laboratory&nbsp;while&nbsp;running away from a monster.&nbsp;Its stocks&nbsp;are uncommonly plentiful.&nbsp;I observed&nbsp;shelves of&nbsp;alkaloids, crates of silver syringes, piles of protective clothes&nbsp;and a journal signed “Vigo.” Its pages&nbsp;are&nbsp;filled with notes on&nbsp;an ancient force that controls&nbsp;the nature of this place—that shapes it.&nbsp;I also noted&nbsp;a few drawings&nbsp;of the&nbsp;growing&nbsp;cankers I’ve&nbsp;seen&nbsp;on trees."
3 - The Blight,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I have been obsessively deciphering Vigo’s journal. His work is elegant but erratic, drawing obscure conclusions from disjointed fields.<br><br>Most entries mention a powerful force, The Entity, which undergoes a purge that occurs once a year. During this period, The Entity is infested with blight. According to Vigo, cankers bloom into “Pustulas,” a type of flower that spurts putrid nectar—the thick fluid I saw oozing from the trees. The last pages of the journal mention a serum distilled from the nectar, but the pages detailing its effects and preparation were torn out."
4 - Wounded,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I’m hiding in a dense strip of forest. I’m desperate to erase the distressful images engraved in my mind. Last night, a disfigured man barged into the laboratory with a gruesome, mechanical mouth and shred the walls into splinters. I barely escaped with my life—and wounded my arm in the process.<br><br>I have no options left; these monsters find me no matter where I go. All I have is a journal filled with obscure promises of escape.<br><br>I will return to the laboratory."
5 - Experiment,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I’m close to death, I can feel it.<br><br>When I returned to the laboratory, I started experimenting with the putrid nectar and distilled it into a foul serum. But I made a terrible mistake. I injected the serum into a dead rodent, whose pupils dilated, and its body shook. I tried to restrain it, but the creature bit into my arm, ripping my wound open.<br><br>I stopped the bleeding, but I fear the damage is done."
6 - Experiment II,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I awoke to a terrible cry booming from the cellar and a violent bout of nausea. Through the vile ordeal, I started to recollect what had happened.<br><br>Tainted with the foul serum, my wound had swollen with lymph, at which point my assailant returned. Most of our fight was a blur, but I can recall red tears trickling down his gruesome cheeks as I clawed at his face. And some moment later when I kicked him, sending him crashing into a brick wall. The power I felt then… there are no words for it. I now know that there is truth to Vigo’s methods.<br><br>Another cry. My assailant, now chained in the cellar, must be getting restless.<br><br>This is just the beginning."
7 - The Peak,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I should have foreseen his escape, given the potent dosage I administered him, but I needed to see results.<br><br>Pustula flowers are now blooming on the path leading to the laboratory. According to Vigo’s journal, this rapid spread is a sign that the blight is at its peak.<br><br>Soon, there will be no more putrid nectar to extract."
8 - Exhausted,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I slept very little. The acute throbbing in my wound sent me on a restless, agitated drowse. I have no strength left to be patient, and my distress fosters brutal methods.<br><br>There are no lines I will not cross."
9 - Restless,Tome05_Halloween2018,"I limited my rest to only a few minutes here and there--I cannot afford wasting time. Pustulas, once lush with nectar, were withering away at the roots of cankerous trees. I could only extract droplets from a few frail flowers.<br><br>I’m running out of time."
MEMORY 3728,Tome05_Hillbilly,"In the darkness of his cell he hears footsteps approaching. He hears laughter and gossip. His father with others. He's not sure who he's with. He puts his ear to the door and hears a laugh, a deep guttural laugh. He feels his skin crawl and his stomach twist in knots. It can only be Chief. He hates Chief especially when he's with his Pa. They make him do all kinds of things for fun and laughs. His Pa brags about his killing tool as he often calls him. More laughter. Other voices. Chief brought some deputies to enjoy the show. He wants to smash them all to bits just to make them stop laughing. Everyone laughs at him. The whole world laughs at him. He grinds his teeth with frustration. They ain't supposed to laugh. They're supposed to protect him and he knows it. He's seen it on his TV, the only thing that calms him and keeps him company when he's done his work. TV is something special… the friend and parent he never had… But Chief… Chief ain't like those on TV. He's another kind of Chief of police. The kind that works with Pa to clean money. He doesn't even know what that means but he overheard them by the pigpen talking about cleaning a whole load of money and sharing that load with a judge and other men of the law. They clean money together. That's why Chief lets Pa and Ma do whatever they want to him. Chief is crooked his Pa always says. Crooked like his boy's face. The laughter grows louder. They approach his brick dungeon and he shivers at the thought of more slaughter. He's tired of killing to make a few deputies laugh. Real tired. He feels his blood boiling, feels it rising through his neck, feels it pushing up his face like it wants to burst through his skull. A sudden high-pitching whistling noise fills his ears. He hits his head over and over again until the whining stops. Silence returns, for a moment, just a moment, and then a chain rattles. Bolts snap loudly as he loses balance and falls back to his haunches. The door opens filling his brick cell with blinding sunlight. He covers his eyes with his arm. His Pa steps inside, grabs him, and yanks him to his feet. Come on, Boy! Let's show these deputies your worth!"
MEMORY 3737,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Your Pa says you wanna know your name! Stop running and I'll tell you your fuckin name! Boy stops running. The barking of dogs grows louder and louder. He turns toward Chief's voice and sees moonlight dappling through branches and leaves. He shifts about in the silence not sure what to do. Chief's voice grows louder. Your Pa gave you a name before he realized you were a crooked freak of fuckin nature! Your name shame him! That's why he hides you! You want to know your name, come out with your hands up and I'll tell you! Before Boy realizes what's happening a dog rushes out of the darkness and attacks his arm with a vicious mouth of sharp teeth and dripping slobber. Boy wheels toward a vague, fast-moving shadow and grabs the wrist before the hammer crashes down on his head. He throws the dog against a tree. He's never felt such strength, such power, such resolve. I have a name! He shakes the wrist and the hammer falls with a thud in the gloom below. Boy wrestles Chief to the ground. Chief pulls out a knife. Boy grabs Chief's wrist and forces him to plunge it into his own belly. See my worth now, Chief! See my worth! Chief pulls the bloody knife out. But Boy doesn't give him a chance to react. He plunges his hand into his warm gut and squeezes something he doesn't quite recognize. Chief shrieks in agony. Son of a bitch! The dogs leap at Boy and rip him off Chief before he can do more damage. Boy smashes the dogs to the ground and searches for his hammer to finish his good work. Dogs slowly rouse and bark. He grabs a branch. Smashes them hard and charges away before they attack again. He runs for what feels like forever through the cold, dark woods and heads toward the farm… toward the house where he always should have lived. It's still not too late. There are secret rooms in the basement, rooms where his Pa hid his money and where his Pa and Ma could hurt him without anyone hearing his screams. He bets he could hide there a long time before anyone ever found him. He bets it would be real cozy especially with his TV. And he bets he'll find his name, his real name, in his Pa's stuff. But not before he cooks himself some bacon… some prized bacon."
MEMORY 3729,Tome05_Hillbilly,"In the sweltering barn he stares at the blood dripping from his hammer feeling as though he were in a dream. Strange. Weird. Unhinged. No. Not a dream. More like… like he's living on a TV show… watching himself from a distance. Slaughtered cows thick and wet all around him. Seven or eight of them writhing helplessly in warm, coagulating blood. Heads cracked open. Brain and gore spilling out. Flies buzzing around him, buzzing in his face, buzzing in his ears, telling him this slaughter is who he is. This senseless slaughter is his worth… his only worth. Kill. That's what they love to watch you do. Kill. Kill. Kill. The flies are laughing at him. Laughing with Chief and his deputies. Telling him he's so useless he don't even have a name. Boy! What kind of name is that! His Pa shoves him toward another cow. You ain't done yet! Boy raises his hammer and shakes blood from his eyes. He feels strange. Weird. Unhinged. Fed up. He's had enough of this life. The cell. Shoveling manure. Slaughter. Endless slaughter. And taking care of those pigs. Those prized pigs—pigs given more love by his parents than he ever got. The flies circle his face and laugh at him. The high-pitch whining returns. The pigs got names and you didn't! Duke and Donny. He swats at the flies. Pa nudges him. Come on, Boy, show'em you can do more with that hammer! Boy… That's what Pa calls him. Boy… That's what Ma calls him. They think he's too dumb to know he doesn't have a name. A real name. He knows. All his life he knew. He knew and imagined himself as Max… Max Thomson. Imagined his Pa was so proud of him that he gave him his name. How he dreamed to have his father's name… how he dreamed… Pa shoves him. Come on! Show'em! Show'em now! Boy feels his face fill with blood. His veins swell with fury. His temples throb maddeningly. The next moments are a blur. Blood and screams everywhere! Not bovine… human… the whining begins again and he's confused, searching for his Pa but not finding him. The whining stops and everything is muffled. He turns to see Chief charging him. What have you done!? Boy doesn't really hear him. It's like when Ma held his head in a bucket of water to teach him not to call or cry for her when he was a child. Everything's muffled, distorted, surreal. Chief tackles him and grabs the gory hammer out of his hand. You killed'em! Your Pa! Jim! Don! Ray! My men! My fuckin men! Boy pushes Chief off and tumbles out of the barn, drenched in blood, heading toward the main house, screaming for his Ma in the growing dusk."
MEMORY 3730,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Ma sobs on the ground with a mouth full of cracked teeth. Boy lifts her with one arm and a flood of inarticulate words rush out of his mouth. Words he only understands. Words the TV taught him. He wants to know his name, his real name, and she just stares at him, confused, lost, desperate. She gurgles blood and chips of tooth slip down the side of her face as she begs for her life. Even if she understood what he was saying she could tell him nothing. My name! My name! What's my name! Boy slams his Ma against the ground again and again. He lifts her over his head and hurtles her against the kitchen table. It breaks under her weight. Blood gushes from a wound in her leg. She loses consciousness. He feels bad and holds his limp body. Why? Why did you hate me? What did I do to make you both hate me so much? Her face is beautiful and hideous at the same time. Evil veiled by beauty. He hugs her, harder and harder, wishing everything would have been different, wishing he were one of those damn pigs. They spoiled them with love, affection and time—all that time they spent Duke and Donny while he groveled nameless and alone in a dungeon built just for him. He tries to lift her but slips in a pool of her blood. She struggles in his embrace. Every time he asks the question he squeezes her tighter and tighter. My name… What's my name? Her struggles cease and she jerks spasmodically. Tense arms and legs go limp. He releases her slowly. Her head thumps hard in a puddle of blood. She stares upward with blue vacant eyes. Beautiful blue vacant eyes. Eyes that only saw a monster, a thing, a beast of burden to work the farm. Never a son. Never her son. He hates those eyes. Those…those… hateful eyes. He rips them out and squeezes. They pop like bovine eyes. He smiles and doesn't really know why he's smiling. He wipes blood off his face and likes the mushy feeling in his hands. He hears a foot pound the floor behind him. Chief suddenly rushes into the kitchen. I'm gonna smash your head with your own goddamn hammer! But as he lifts the hammer he slips in an inch of warm blood. Boy panics and rushes outside into the darkening woods with Chief screaming and cursing and bullets whipping by him."
MEMORY 3731,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Boy doesn't know how long he's been running but he's tired. He hears Chief yelling and hollering after him in the distance. Says he regrets the day he told his parents to keep him as a farm-hand. Says he told Ma and Pa that a monster-kid would make a damn good worker. Says others things, too. Things Boy doesn't want to hear. Your parents tried to kill you. Let a pot of boiling water spill over you, and told us you were a clumsy child. They says you pulled the pot down from the stove, but I knew better. I seen right through'em. Too embarrassed of their deformed kid that they poured scalding water over him. Tried to kill you! Tried to make it look like an accident. Boy covers his ears. Flies buzz about, laughing. He doesn't want to hear this. A high pitch ringing echoes though his mind. Stop! Stop! Stop! But it won't stop. He knows he's the only one who can hear the whining and laughing flies. He knows he hears things. He knows his Pa hurt him. Hurt his head. Screamed too loud in his ear when he was a baby. Screamed mean things. Mean things like he wished Ma's belly-cord strangled him completely and not just halfway. He takes a moment to gather himself. He hears other voices. Chief called in more deputies. Doesn't matter. Let them all come. They all deserve to pay for doing nothing while his Ma and Pa made him suffer."
MEMORY 3732,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Boy squeezes the neck so tight screams quickly fade into pathetic whimpers. Easier to kill a man than a cow. Only a man makes much more of a fuss. Boy stares in the deputy's panicking eyes and knows this one. Knows him well. This one laughed at him many times. Laughed at him when he should have helped him. Who's laughing now! Didn't you watch TV. The police are supposed to help, not hurt. Laugh at me now! Boy lifts him off his feet and pounds the back of the head against a tree. Over and over again! Laugh now! Laugh! Laugh! The skull splits open like a melon and brain mass hangs from one side. Boy releases him and the dying deputy can barely keep his balance. He toddles left and right and stops in front of Boy. For a moment he stares at him as though seeing something more than a tool or a freak show. Something smarter than a mule. Smarter and deadlier. The deputy seems lost and confused… like a mindless zombie on TV. The trembling, confused deputy shuffles forward feeling his wet mushy head. Boy moves to the side to let him pass and stares at his good work. Stares at the gore dripping from his skull like putty. Watches him stagger left and right in the moonlight. If he were a cow, he'd end his suffering. But he's not a cow. He's something else. Something vile and corrupt. Boy watches him disappear in the shadows. He stares at the darkness until he hears a thud. A strange feeling fills his heart and he… laughs. Feels good to fight back and show them his worth—his real worth."
MEMORY 3733,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Boy hears Chief searching frantically for him. He sits still by a tree covered by bramble, squeezing a handful of deputy brain. It's got the same texture as cow brain. He probably couldn't tell the difference if he had a lump in each hand. He squeezes and likes the feeling. It soothes him, calms him, relieves his anxiety. His thoughts wander to his favorite TV shows. Ma and Pa let him have a TV to shut him up. They got tired of him smashing the wall and crying for them. Nothing worked. Not the gag or the rope that he always managed to get out of. Only the TV. TV was better than any constraint. It kept him sitting down, passive, complacent and quiet. Ma said it hypnotized him and that was a good thing. The TV showed Boy so many things. Showed him how different his life was from other children. Showed him what parents should have been like. He wishes his parents were more like Clark's parents. They made a hero out of their son just by being good to him and raising him right. They took good care of him and he wasn't even theirs. Or… the other parents… the parents of that other boy, Beaver. He had a good family. But he wasn't like them. He wasn't like Clark or Beaver. He came into the world hurt, deformed and weak like a runt. His Pa told him he had wanted to stuff him in a bag with rocks and throw him in the lake. Tough love. Tough life. Tough everything. He hears deputies shouting in the distance. Boy feels scared and does what he usually does in his brick cell. He closes his eyes and thinks of Clark and waits for the greatest of all heroes to save him. He never comes and it's not like TV. He's always there to save the day. He's always there to help those who need help. But TV ain't reality and he's alone. He's alone because he was born a crooked little beast. Boy opens his eyes and stares at the gory lump in his hand. Doesn't matter. Enough waiting. He's own kind of hero today."
MEMORY 3734,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Chief screams his anger. Found bits and pieces of another deputy. Boy is picking them off like cattle in a barn yard. Chief swears to hell and beyond he'll make him pay. Make me pay? Me? You're the one who's gonna pay for letting me rot in that cell for all those years. Chief calms down and calls someone. Tells them to bring the dogs. Bring them! Won't make a difference. No matter what he ain't ever going back to that cell or any other cell for that matter. He'll die a thousand deaths before they ever lock him up again. He wants to rush out of the darkness and grab him but something tells him that's exactly what Chief wants. He's trying to lure him with hurtful words. Boy sits in the shadows and stirs the dry leaves with one hand. He sees a deputy approaching with a flashlight. He grabs a thick branch and slowly rises and inches toward him. A hare springs in the air and bounds away. The deputy trains the flashlight on the rodent. He releases an anxious breath just as Boy swings the branch like Babe Ruth. Head and neck are smashed open and the dark contents splatter on the trees and ground. Yet the deputy doesn't fall. He stumbles here and there with his smashed head barely hanging by sinews of flesh, his hands desperately reaching out and feeling the cool, night air. Reminds Boy of a decapitated chicken fluttering about the yard searching for its head. Boy smiles and feels liberated. He laughs to himself. Another deputy made clean. His Pa cleaned Chief's money now Boy cleans his deputies. Like father like son. He thinks of Chief and loses his smile. He could have helped him… all those years… he could have helped him."
MEMORY 3735,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Boy! You wanna know your name! I knows it! Come out and I'll whisper it in your useless, mangled ear! Chief's playing games with him and he ain't gonna be fished. Chief swears he's gonna hunt him all night and that he's got dogs coming. Dogs that can track a cricket fart in pile of manure. Boy didn't even know crickets farted. He learned a lot of things on TV but never that. The thought of a cricket farting makes Boy smile. He likes smiling. He crawls closer to the police crew. Two new men on the hunt with Chief but he doesn't see any dogs. He figures he best take them down before the dogs arrive. He's seen police dogs on TV. They can sniff out anything. These deputies seem angrier than the last. He's not sure if it's because he felled their friends or if he ended their cleaning racket with his Pa. Maybe both. He just gets the sense if they catch him they'll make him suffer and squeal like a pig. Those pigs. Those damn pigs they loved so much. Why did they have to love them so much and him so little. Had they treated him like those pigs he would have been happy. He would have been happy and he would have been something else. He would have been a hero like that boy who wore a cape and helped the world all because of how his Ma and Pa raised him."
MEMORY 3736,Tome05_Hillbilly,"Boy creeps up behind two deputies he can barely make out in the moonlight. He slowly raises a pointy branch, leaps out, knocks one head and thrusts the branch through the mouth of the other before he can yell for help. He stares down at the blood gushing out like a geyser. Reminds him of a scene in a cowboy movie. He approaches the other deputy. The deputy turns and grabs Boy. They roll over the crunching leaves and fallen branches exchanging blows. Boy manages to wrap his arm around his neck and squeezes. Legs thrash wildly here and there. Boy squeezes until they stop at once. He hears Chief calling back his deputies. He tells them to come back. Says the dogs have arrived. Boy retreats into the bramble and shadows. He closes his eyes imagines a different life for himself. He's the Beaver boy, sitting at a table, eating a wholesome meal with his Pa and Ma and they're asking about his day. Then everything changes when he speaks. The sounds upset his Ma. She beats him across the head, holds him down and pours hot sauce down his throat and tells him to never speak again. His Pa grabs him and gives him a lashing with his belt. His eyes spring open. Everything could have been so different had he not been born a monster. Born a monster? Monsters aren't born. They're made. Made in a crucible of hate, cruelty and abuse. Hot sauce and belts! That's the stuff of monsters."
MEMORY 683,Tome05_Nea,"Nea skates over to Falls City park, searching for her friend Casey but doesn't find her. She skates to her home and her mother says she's in The Narrows handing out water bottles with a grassroots organization calling themselves Life Drop. Life Drop? The Narrows? What's Casey gotten herself into this time? You know Casey, probably some save-the-bees organization that just doesn't understand the way the world works. No such thing as the American Dream anymore, only the Corporate Dream and the Corporate Dream and the American Dream ain't the same thing. She's read about The Narrows… supposed to be the poorest and most polluted district in Falls City. Maybe it's because it's the poorest that it's also the most polluted. Maybe it's because of corrupt yet legal policy against those who can't afford the big lawyers to change or challenge the corrupt policy. Paper mills. Car factories. Toxic waste facilities. All dumping on the land and water. A few politicians set the dollar price to poison the environment and an entire community of blue-collar workers pay the price, the ultimate price, with their health and lives. Nothing new. Same old, same old. The fat-cats and bureaucrats keep doing it because they can. So long as there's money to be made in poisoning the world, someone will be there to make it. That's everywhere, every city she ever read about, and Falls City ain't no exception. She used to care, but then there was too much to care about, and so she decided it was easier not to care anymore. Funny how that happened. All she cares about now is skateboarding and finding the impossible place to tag. Whatever, maybe she'll find something to tag in The Narrows. She skates down the street following Upper Falls River toward the poorest and most polluted district in Falls City."
MEMORY 692,Tome05_Nea,"Nea is amazed at how many poor communities shower, bathe, cook and do their laundry in poison water because a few kings bought the rights to their good water. It's absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. She's never felt so involved in a cause before and she likes the feeling. Possibly her first cause since school tried to stifle her voice with fear of making mistakes… of saying something… of having a message… of going against the corporate dream. Not the American dream, the corporate dream. Nea surfs the net and reads about the kings and their scramble for fresh water all over the world. She's happy to read it's not going so well. In every country where these tyrant kings tried to own fresh water they were kicked out by the people. Yet these stories are difficult to find. Kings losing battles to peasants is rarely breaking news or news at all. Almost like the kings want to make sure no one gets inspired to fight against them as they desperately scramble to buy up all the water they didn't poison. They want it all. They want to sell it. And they don't want peasants getting in their way. Water is everything.. Owning water is like owning life. Owning water is deciding who lives or dies. And that's what the kings and the mayor did in Falls City. They condemned and poisoned an entire community and did nothing to help them. And did nothing… Nea hopes in a higher justice, one that can't be owned or bribed, and she swears she'll turn the mayor's new luxury car into a work of rebellion. Can't change the world, but you can make it a little bit better. A little bit better… that's enough for her."
MEMORY 684,Tome05_Nea,"What are you and the moms doing? Nea approaches Casey and several middle-aged women handing out water bottles and cases to local residents. Casey turns to Nea. What are we doing? Anything we can to help. Nea laughs and nudges Casey. Let's go to the park. Casey nudges her back. Not today Nea, this is important… another day… Nea watches Casey and the other women handing out water to the poor. How many kids at home? Three? Okay, here's a dozen bottles. Four? Okay, take an extra container. When is our water going to be safe? The hell if I know. Is it dangerous to shower? To do the laundry? How bad is the water? Pretty bad. The water is killing our children. We need a center to treat the poisoned. Nea listens to all the talk with horror and disbelief. She's never really had to think about something as basic and essential as water and now… she's thinking about water… polluted water… and the poor in her city. They're saying it's the worst case of Minamata disease in the country. She doesn't know what that is… Minamata… but it sounds bad, real bad. What's Minamata? Casey looks upset or disturbed as she hands out another container of fresh water to a resident. It's what happens when people are poisoned with mercury. Nea sighs, feels for the residents, but knows shit happens and there's just not much you can do about it. We can't save the world, Casey? What's a few containers of bottled water gonna do? Casey freezes and gives Nea a look she doesn't quite understand. It's a moment before she responds. Yeah, well, maybe we can't save the world, Nea, but we can sure as hell make it a little bit better, and that's good enough for me."
MEMORY 685,Tome05_Nea,"Can't save the world but we can make it a little bit better and that's good enough for me. Nea thought about Casey's response the entire night as she researched the horrors of the Minamata disease. Deterioration of motor skills. Walking and speaking degenerate. Random convulsions. Paralysis. Children born with twisted limbs. All permanent side-effects of mercury poison. Mayor cut a deal with a beverage company. They rerouted good, healthy water from a clean lake for a bottled water facility that bought the rights to the water and connected The Narrows to the old river system. They thought no one would notice. They thought it wouldn't be that bad. They thought wrong. When mothers began losing their unborn children and everyone began to lose their hair fifty thousand residents began to notice. They noticed, they complained, but no one did a thing. Business as usual. Nea takes a deep breath and releases it slowly. She's never really had to think about water and now that's all she's thinking about."
MEMORY 686,Tome05_Nea,"Come see this creepy, abandoned factory I just tagged. Casey shrugs. I have no time for your ego. Ego? What are you talking about? Casey shakes her head. Big deal, Nea. Your name on a ruined wall, or whatever, who cares. Why not stand for something? Say something? All that time and energy just to say you tagged a scary place. Whoopie. Big fuckin deal. Nea scrunches her face. She feels under attack. What's going on with you? Casey shrugs. I don't know… If you'd at least piss off a tyrant, you would have done something with your… your… art… if that's what you want to call it. Nea doesn't say anything. She doesn't know what to say. She takes her board and heads down to The Narrows. She stares at the overgrown and abandoned factories lining the river. They came. They profited. They left. It's so stupid and it's so simple. You poison the water you die. No money or power or law will change that."
MEMORY 687,Tome05_Nea,"The Zyderr production mill. That's where I'll do it. They dumped crap in the river for years destroying the camping and fishing industry all over the country. Twenty years later The Narrows dies a slow, agonizing death and there's no justice and there probably never will be. There isn't even an investigation or a hospital or a center to treat the poisoned. The environmental agency says everything's fine, but it isn't. It really isn't. No one wants to say its mercury poisoning. To admit to mercury poisoning is to admit fault. To admit fault is to help The Narrows and pay for a cleanup. The city doesn't want a lawsuit. No one is moving or doing anything and yet children are suffering and dying. Children are suffering and dying… and no one is doing anything… and Nea can't stop thinking about them. Takes a special kind of evil to poison children. Something about the whole thing makes her want to get involved, real involved, like her friend Casey. Maybe she should tag those so-called public servants who only serve themselves."
MEMORY 688,Tome05_Nea,"Nea skates to the side wall of the bottling factory. They make glass and plastic bottles for fresh water and dump their chemicals and poisons in the river. How fuckin stupid is this place. How stupid is the city and that bastard of a mayor to allow such a thing. She searches for the perfect spot, the perfect surface to tag. She sees a spot high up in the open. That should annoy them. She sneaks to the front door, sees a camera, spray paints the lens of camera, begins to tag the wall. They poison water to provide bottles for good water. Absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. Nea finishes her good work with time and paint to spare. She searches the premises and finds a large white garage door. Smiles. Perfect. She'll tag her name nice and big for everyone to see. That oughta piss off a tyrant as Casey says. The cause is actually getting to Nea and she wishes her art would piss the factory and the city enough for them to clean up the river. Wishful thinking. They came. They profited. They left… left an entire community poisoned. Gotta be laws against that and maybe even a death sentence for those who knowingly poison children."
MEMORY 689,Tome05_Nea,"So you tagged their building. Big deal. Means nothing. You got your name out there… that's what you did… but what does that name stand for? Nea doesn't know how to respond to Casey. She's never really attached a message to her street name like others. It's just not something she thought she'd ever do. It's not about a message. It's about art. Casey says art is the message. Art is rebellion. Some call it preaching. Who said that? Who made that up? The corporations… Nea… of course they did. Get artists scared of using their art, of saying anything against their abuse and they win. Centuries ago artists protested tyrant kings and those tyrants did all they could to own or stifle their art through fear of poverty or fear of death. Nea… kings still exist… they do… just in different ways. Today the kings are CEOS and their kingdoms are corporations and some are good kings and others… not so good… and the not so good one have found other ways to keep artists in line. Scare them in school. Tell them not to make a statement. Tell them to stand for something. Appeal to all. Just entertain. Entertain and inspire but don't say something. Don't be political. Nea… everything is political. Not say something is say something. Turning your back and ignoring corruption is a choice, a political choice of indifference. Nea sighs. She doesn't know. She's not sure. She's never really done it before like the others. It always kind of rubbed her the wrong way. Casey scoffs at her tag. Stand up for something or stand for nothing. Your choice as an artist. Your political choice."
MEMORY 690,Tome05_Nea,"Come with me. Casey jumps on her board and leads Nea into The Narrows. She leads her to a home where a father helps his son eat food in his bed. He's only eleven. Never had a chance. The only mistake was trusting those who were supposed to protect him. He's dying. Mercury poisoning. Before people in The Narrows died of natural causes… now it's all mercury poisoning. Casey sighs and shakes her head. You sign your tag over the culprit's garage door and all you've done is advertise your street name. I heard your bullshit about not using your tag for a cause. What's the use of a tag then? What the use of a voice if you ain't gonna say anything? Ain't gonna stand up for something. Art is an act of defiance. Not an act of profit. Not an act of fame. Say something, Nea. Let the world know what's in your heart. Someone just might listen and do something. Lend your voice to the voiceless. Not rebel without a cause. Rebel with a cause."
MEMORY 691,Tome05_Nea,"Nea thinks about what Casey said as she lies in bed staring at a glass of water. Casey's right, and Nea remembers a time when she wanted to say so much as a street artist. Somehow that got stamped out of her. She tries to remember how it got stamped out of her. The only thing she can think about is… school. No messages. No politics. Nothing. Just inspire and entertain. Yet corporations have messages and politics. Politics of selling. She remembers being told not to use art for politics yet who does that benefit? Kings. Tyrant kings trying to own voices or stifle voices by creating an inner self-editor that begins in school. Keep politics out of it! Keep politics out of it? Everything is politics even the act of trying to stay out of politics. Politics… fuckin politics… fuckin corrupt mayor… Bastard didn't just switch good water for poison water… he sold the good water to a corporate king. Absurd. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. She never heard of such a thing. No one should own the rights to water. No one. Water belongs to everyone. To all living things. Nea stares at a spray paint can on her dresser. She thinks of something to say. Something to make people stop and take notice. For the first time in a long time she doesn't care if it's a message or a political statement. Screw her high school art teacher who made her feel insecure about making statements with her creations. Water is health. Water is strength. Water is a human right… Water is a human right… a basic human right."
ARCUS 7525,Tome05_Observer,"It's hard to say what came over me and I can hardly recollect the last few hours perhaps even days. I awoke with several empty whiskey bottles and dead bodies sprawled across the roof. Not too far from the scene was my gory nine iron and a phonograph playing a solemn, French song about life in a city I will never truly know. I turned the bodies over one by one and they vaguely resembled those who had forsaken me to this infernal prison. I must have conjured them and destroyed them in the same evening. But… with a nine iron? I imagined far worse fates for them. I even have a journal devoted to dark and creative ideas on how I might actually one day make them pay for their corruption and impertinence."
ARCUS 5798,Tome05_Observer,"Incidents don't make sense anymore. Nothing does. Everything is a chaotic blur of unreal apparitions and jumbled memories. I can barely recognize my own thoughts or distinguish my memories from those I've been studying. Last night I relived the most horrific murders in my collection with a strange kind of… pleasure… When I had had enough, I looked in the mirror and did not see myself but dozens of faces morphing in and out of each other. Every possible face except my own. I thrust my fist into the mirror and my hand split and blood was everywhere. What cruel fate has befallen me that I should lose myself in the darkness while trying to escape its deadly grasp. The Auris will be either be my salvation or my downfall."
ARCUS 337,Tome05_Observer,"At first glance the endless bloodshed seems to be an act to satisfy some destructive instinct within The Entity. This seems to me a reductionist distortion of something more sophisticated, something more intricate, something even sacred. Beyond the horror, the shedding of blood and the very real appearance of death puts us in touch with life and can be an intoxicating and highly addictive experience on the deepest and most archaic levels. When our blood, or our life-force is offered to The Entity, it can be seen as a gift that is soon returned to us so that the horror may continue again and again. The world constantly churns with life and death, and death and life—the circulation of blood through an Old One from heart to body to kidney back to the heart again to be purified and begin anew."
ARCUS 1007,Tome05_Observer,"A new doorway has opened. For how long? I'm not sure nor have I ever been right even with my best guesses. Through the door of my study and into a lost and forgotten realm. Moss-grown, stone homes with doorways barricaded with wagons, planks of wood and decaying corpses tangled in barbed wire. I walk by the homes gazing at the residual memories of soldiers killing villagers with swords for no other reason than the thrill of it. I can't make out which era or terra world this realm is from. I search the realm for hints of how one may open an actual doorway back home. Somewhere in these memories and forgotten realms is the answer to my salvation. But… which ones… which ones indeed…"
ARCUS 2217,Tome05_Observer,"I have uncovered to my amazement and bewilderment memories of Claudette that are unlike any of those I've previously experienced. One might even say they should not belong to her… and yet… they are hers. I surmise these memories may belong to another Claudette from another terra world, suggesting that this Old One may have clear preferences at the cosmic buffet for certain souls. It will take more samples of these memories to know if they are in fact from another Claudette or if, and it is possible, I am having troubles deciphering between her actual memories and her creative musings."
ARCUS 8557,Tome05_Observer,"I tremble as I scribble this down. Squid-like creatures difficult to describe attempt to penetrate my tower, trying to destroy my study and tools to explore and manifest. I held them off for as long as I could, then, taking the Auris and other valuables, I rushed through a doorway and hid in a lost realm. When I returned, the tower was upside-down, my study completely ransacked, the creatures lay dead on the floor with black, putrid blood leaking out of them, and the smell of decaying fish was everywhere. What are these creatures and who is sending them if not this brutish monster of an Old One. I spent hours cursing and throwing these fetid carcasses out of my window and back into the abyss."
ARCUS 5738,Tome05_Observer,"An odd impulse caused me to climb to the roof and light a single candle in the pitch blackness of it all. When the candle extinguished, I thrust myself off the roof and plunged to my certain death but somehow ended up back in my bed as though I was waking up from a nightmare. I don't know what I was thinking but what this has shown me is… death is not an option."
ARCUS 1275,Tome05_Observer,I have often wondered if those trapped here have ever paused to reflect upon the inexplicable significance of this world that defies not only time and space but death. A world made of memories that is neither consistent or constant. Something akin to a collective dream made of the collective memories and beliefs of its inhabitants. Sometimes I wonder if not all worlds were like this in some respect and that reality is what we in fact dream it to be or believe it to be.
ARCUS 8545,Tome05_Observer,"I was woken mid-slumber by a delirium of shrieks and destruction so that I rushed to the closest window to see only the endless black fog swirling outside. Things in the fog were coming to life and dying simultaneously as though The Entity were sick or in some kind of shock. Creatures roared and fought and tore each other apart somewhere in the raging abyss and it was both entertaining and unsettling. I grabbed a nine iron and held it at the ready, waiting for some apparition to attack me. But within moments it was all over, and I couldn't sleep, and so I took the edge off with a little whiskey and golf on the roof the whole while cursing this blasted Old One and hoping what I had just experienced was nothing more than cosmic indigestion."
ARCUS 8789,Tome05_Observer,There are dead bodies in my study and I have no recollection of the last few days. The bodies have been flayed from head to toe and the faces have been beaten to an unrecognizable pulp. I dragged them to the window and thrust them out into the abyss wondering who they were and why they were in my tower. Did I manifest them? Did I create them for company? Or did they come from somewhere else? Had I been the one who butchered them? Had I lost myself so deeply in a memory that I became someone else for a short time? Perhaps they are not my creations but apparitions from the fog sent by The Entity like the creatures I hear lurking about in the fog now and then.
Memory 906,Tome06_Nurse,"There is a reprieve this night in the asylum, and Sally does what any sane person would do—she clings to it with all her strength. The weight that sits in her chest melts away, allowing for one starving breath. The scent of sweat and dusty linen is willed from her mind, replaced with memories of tomatoes and fresh soil. Her feet take her down the hall, heels clicking, echoing into an expanse of shadows. She does not allow herself to see the stains on the walls or the fracture in the window's pane. She could draw them from memory but, for this moment, they cease to exist.<br><br>As Sally reaches the end of the hall, she peers into a patient's room, illuminated by a blade of moonlight cutting across the floor. A young girl, sitting atop the bed, flinches at the oncoming shadow. Only as Sally walks into the moonlight does the girl release her grip on a bundle of sheets. Sally offers a sympathetic smile to her… the Anxious Girl. The asylum's file lists her name as Marion but the staff have codes for each patient. The Catatonic Boy, the Sweaty Codger, the Anxious Girl. Everything they are summarized into two words.<br><br>Sally sits on the edge of the bed, braiding the Anxious Girl's dry, brittle hair. Did you visit the community room today? The Anxious Girl hugs her pillow. I stayed here. A light moan carries through the hall, the first indication that peace will soon be broken. Sally does her best to ignore it, weaving one strand of hair over another. Did you know that room has a chair by the window? You can see the robins building a nest in the trees. The Anxious Girl looks to the hallway, her shoulders tensing as she listens to the distant moan. Sally gently rubs the girl's shoulder, wordlessly offering her sympathy. They sit for a short time until a scream carries through the hallway."
Memory 915,Tome06_Nurse,"Sally fills the syringe as the Broken Woman instructed. Thick, dark liquid swirls within, a night sky void of stars. The helpless anxiety that crippled her vanishes under a sea of calm.<br><br>Though her heels click with each step, she feels as if she floats; as if everything she's to do has been determined, requiring only the gentlest breeze to push her forward. She sees the sickness clearly. It has infected all. But the most hideous, is the one who refuses to face it; the dog that doesn't know it's a dog. And so, she makes her way to the Broken Woman's room.<br><br>Strange how, for all the woman's wisdom, she is blind to her impurities. Though she removes the blemishes from her skin, she fails to judge the mismatched eyes that gaze at her in the mirror. But no amount of carving can remove genetics. Such a case requires extreme measures.<br><br>Sally grips the syringe and prepares for what's to come. There is such filth that permeates the asylum—if she is to cleanse it all, she had best begin."
Memory 907,Tome06_Nurse,"Sally marches down the hall to the source of the scream. Patients, each in their own rooms, react, an interlude of cries and shrieks joining in, accompanied by the thumping of a head slamming into a wall. The volume builds, louder and more chaotic, until finally, as if reaching a crescendo, a patient howls. Sally rushes into a room, moving towards a hideously scarred woman, restrained to the bed, whose scream slowly dies into soft, mirthful laughter. Did you enjoy the song, sweet nurse? I call it Concerto of Lunatics.<br><br>The asylum is wide awake now, alive, anxious, the scattered shrieks and moans of patients ricocheting through the halls. Sally's chest tightens, as she struggles to breathe. Why… why must you rile them? The Broken Woman smiles beneath the swath of bandages over her scarred face. Through two small holes, mismatched eyes—blue and orange—sparkle. Oh, sweet nurse, what are the jesters for if not a laugh? Sally knows to step away, knows there is nothing to gain from arguing, yet she cannot restrain herself. They are humans and, sick as they may be, they deserve sympathy. This is a line Sally has told herself many times over the years, though that is all it has become—a line; a series of carefully rehearsed words pushed through chapped lips. Perhaps this is why the Broken Woman chuckles as if trading quips with a friend. They deserve sympathy? Most have contributed nothing but pain, and the others have contributed nothing at all."
Memory 908,Tome06_Nurse,"Sally makes no attempt to suppress her disgust as she looks at the Broken Woman's smile. You would criticize your fellow patients for bringing nothing to this world, yet what have you provided? The Broken Woman awkwardly sits up on her bed, pulling at her restraints like a restless marionette. I have provided more to this world than a thousand missionaries. When I saw sickness, I did not coddle it, feed it, wipe the tears from its eyes—I cleansed it! The Broken Woman sees she has Sally's attention. If we want humanity to survive, we must be its custodians, sweet nurse. And yet… we have allowed an infection to fester—the evidence pervading these walls. The Broken Woman pauses, allowing her point to settle. Shrieks and moans from the mentally insane echo through the halls.<br><br>Sally feels her nerves tighten with each chaotic noise that comes her way. She has little desire to argue, yet duty compels. Are you not within these walls too? Would that not make you part of the infection? The Broken Woman smiles as if expecting this question. I am the solution, condemned to the halls of the infected. Like you, I was a nurse. But I served not the patients but the greater good. With one simple injection I removed the weak from the gene pool. I watched them in their death throes, knowing my actions were backed by honest science so few have the strength to trust. And do you know what the courts called me for following logic? Insane!"
Memory 909,Tome06_Nurse,"The days pass, but Sally's unsure how many. She always finds herself back in the asylum, tending to the frantic, the violent, the feeble. Down the hall, the Bad Man has slipped his restraints again. Like a wolf, he shows no motive but to prowl for the weak, and it appears he's found his prey. He drags the naked body of the Rancid Son by the ankles. Blood spills from the Son's head. Sally does not know if the man is dead. Calling for help, she sprints down the hall with a syringe filled of sedatives. There are no other nurses to come to her aid. Financial restrictions have seen to that. She considers that she is running to her death this time, but there is something involuntary in her movements, as if she has become a spectator. The Bad Man lets go of the Rancid Son's ankles and turns his attention to Sally. He fails to notice Harvey Kavanagh, the plump orderly, round the corner behind him. Harvey slams The Bad Man into the floor as he's done to so many patients. Sally jabs a sedative into the Bad Man's neck. The Bad Man sags in place and with a look of bewilderment falls to the ground.<br><br>The decrepit hall is silent. Sally looks over the scene at her feet. Kavanagh's sizable frame hefts up and down as he catches his breath, thick arm slung over The Bad Man who rests peacefully. The Rancid Son, either unconscious or dead, lies beneath them with Kavanagh's boot pressed against his nostril. The smear of blood from his head goes on for thirty feet down the hall before curling into an adjacent room. Sally laughs to stop herself from screaming."
Memory 910,Tome06_Nurse,"Sally finds herself in the Broken Woman's room. The mismatched eyes of the Broken Woman appear sympathetic as the sunlight shimmers over them, yet she speaks with sharpened words. Shame about that bloody disturbance yesterday. Boys like that are made a certain way… not built for civil society. The big, brutish one, well, it is as plain as the skin on his face. And the other, oh, the other one hides it well. But have you looked at his family name? That will explain everything.<br><br>Sally wills herself to think of a gentle lake, lilies and—no… all she can see are the grimy asylum walls and bloody bandages. There are no gentle breezes to distract her, only the Broken Woman's voice prodding deeper. Did you not have a husband, sweet nurse? I recall the newspaper article… hand to heart, my dear, I cried at his unfortunate death. You would have had beautiful babies. To now be here, a widow of pure genes, serving the filth of the world—such a turn of events.<br><br>Sally gets up, leaving a bandage half-wrapped. Her feet shuffle imprecisely as she moves for the door. She tries to push her thoughts away, knows she shouldn't think it, but—it is such cruelty. Her love was pure, her husband pure, and those who live in these halls are anything but. Yet these sick, twisted beasts, receive the care and attention deserved to the man she lost.<br><br>Her throat catches on each breath. Her vision blurs. She wants to run but knows it's no use. No matter where she goes, she always finds herself back in these halls. With swirling thoughts, one stark realization breaks through: it is not she who keeps the insane confined to these halls, but the insane who confine her.<br><br>She falls to the unforgiving floor."
Memory 911,Tome06_Nurse,"A lush green field dotted with salmon-colored lilies and patches of pine trees surround the lake. The colors are more vibrant than Sally remembers, and though it smells of fresh rain, the sky is clear. Andrew sits next to her on a blanket, his blonde hair nearly white in the sun. She wears the dress he had bought her. A symbol of my love, he had written on the card, and for a man of few words it meant many.<br><br>He wipes the grass stains from his calloused hands and turns to Sally. We should get home. The lake will still be here tomorrow. A cold breeze sweeps through the meadow, bringing with it the scent of sweat and dusty linen. She grips his wrist with both hands. Just one more minute, please. One more.<br><br>She hears saws ripping through lumber, the sound heightening with each violent slash. Tighter, she holds Andrew's wrist, pressing her head into his shoulder and bracing herself. An immense tree slams to the ground behind her, sending twigs and dirt into the air. One after another, they come down in booming, ground-shaking jolts. Sally coughs through a cloud of dust, keeping her grip on Andrew the entire time.<br><br>A bead of blood trickles down his arm, coming to rest on her finger. She looks up to see her husband's skull broken open, spilling blood and chunks of brain. One stark white eye looks out from the carnage, focused intently on her. We would have had beautiful babies, Sally.<br><br>She collapses into the crimson muck of his chest and cries. The skin on her hands flakes away, turning to dust. She loses her grip on him. Everything she was, down to the dress she wore, decays, blown away in the wind.<br><br>The sweaty hands of Kavanagh shake her as she awakes on the asylum floor."
Memory 912,Tome06_Nurse,"She's in the hallway again. The scent, the stains, her heels clicking—it's the same. Occasional moans and shouts carry from nearby rooms, short bursts of mania or terror that emerge and intermingle: The Concerto of Lunatics.<br><br>Sally enters the Anxious Girl's room and sits at the foot of her bed. The girl flinches but, after a second's pause, lifts herself up. Illuminated under moonlight, she offers a timid yet warm smile. Sally takes three strands of the girl's hair and begins to weave a braid. Did you see the robins today? But Sally doesn't wait for the girl's answer. Another day hiding, wasn't it? And what about the robins? They will be dead by the time you leave this room.<br><br>The girl's shoulders tense and Sally feels herself do the same. She takes a deep breath, attempting to calm herself. As she parts the hair back from the Anxious Girl's skull, she spies tiny, writhing creatures. An infestation of lice crawls through the girl's hair. Sally pulls her hand back and slaps the girl across her face. Filthy!<br><br>Their eyes lock, confusion and startlement among them both. Tears trickle down the Anxious Girl's helpless face, wet chin trembling. Sally takes a step back. She thinks to apologize, to explain the stress she's been under, but something in her refuses. Filthy girl! She storms from the room."
Memory 913,Tome06_Nurse,"Sally, her face emotionally void, sits next to the Broken Woman's bed. She finds herself more and more in this position, listening to the woman ramble. The Broken Woman fidgets with her restraints, fixated on an unscarred piece of skin at the base of her hand. Purification comes in many forms. We must all make sacrifices. She curls a finger inwards and scratches at the clean piece of skin until it's torn off. For the most grotesque offenders—the genetic abominations—we must take extreme measures. Otherwise, you get… well, the results surround you.<br><br>Sally sits motionless, her tired eyes the only indication that she's conscious. The Broken Woman speaks as if chatting with a friend over tea. Do you know what I could do? I could tell you the ingredients for my special injection… the one I used on my patients. A quick little prick and they'll writhe as if a purifying fire burns within. A fitting way to deal with inhuman filth, wouldn't you say? Are you hearing me, sweet nurse? You don't have to be their servant anymore."
Memory 914,Tome06_Nurse,"Sally feels the asylum closing in on her. Whispers of paranoid lunatics spill through the cracks. She wonders how long she can walk this hallway, questions if it ever ends. She passes the Catatonic Boy in his wheelchair, staring deep into the walls. He gazes in her direction though his eyes look through her. Has the trial begun? He lets out a scream, pausing as if having startled himself, then laughs.<br><br>Harvey Kavanagh, the Fat Orderly, emerges from a patient's room and gives her a smile. The skin on his neck dangles as he moves, glistening with sweat. A thick coat of hair covers his arms and curls over the collar of his shirt. His eyes move from Sally's feet upwards, pausing on her chest until he realizes she's watching him. His eyes dart to examine the floor as he nervously licks his mouth.<br><br>Ahead, the Foul Girl skips gracefully, enjoying her first day out of restraints in a month. She hums a pleasant tune, tracing her hand over the wall. As Sally approaches, the Girl tilts her head forward. She lets out a long, guttural sound, heaving her diaphragm until vomit splashes onto the floor. Content with herself, she smiles and skips on.<br><br>Sally continues, giving no thought to cleaning the mess. She sees the Shoeless Imbecile sitting by the broom closet. Thick strands of blood drip from his mouth. With precise rhythm he slams his jaw into the doorframe six times, digs at his gums, and pulls out a tooth. He peers at Sally as if she's the strangest thing he's ever seen.<br><br>Sally looks out at the hallway, stretching on forever. She stops, accepting what she's tried to suppress: the sickness can grow no more."
ARCUS 02,Tome06_Observer,"I am going through some past scribblings and the notes of the previous unknown occupants, and I realize I should at least try to organize them. Reading these notes, I decipher several voices who I am aptly calling the unknown few who like myself had a fixation with the Entity and who like myself had an ability to experience the memories encoded in the fog. I will include my past scribblings and number them as best as I can, referring to them as notes obscura, or just obscura, to try and piece together how long I've actually been here. I think I may have found my first ramblings amongst the half-destroyed journals of the unknown occupants who struggled with infinite possibilities of whiling away the time except the one they probably missed the most. The one I miss the most—friendship, companionship, sitting with my father drinking whiskey and watching the Ancients swim across the night sky, or just losing time with a friend in a hearty conversation about the merits of art, music, laughter and stories. All I have now are the memories of others. Second-hand experiences that constantly remind me of things lost and half-remembered."
OBSCURA. UNKNOWN PRISONERS.,Tome06_Observer,"I've found scattered about this tower countless journals from previous occupants. Occupants might not be the best way to describe them. Prisoners would be more fitting. Eight or nine of them from the distinct voices I deciphered in the manifold journals I read with surprising interest and alacrity. Some of these unknown prisoners shared my unusual penchant for beer, whiskey and stories of the macabre. Others seemed to be raving lunatics writing not journals but senseless notes—notes from the absurd I call them—strange musings and endless contradictions about places and characters observed and consciously or unconsciously improperly described. These notes from the absurd seem to start with unintelligible gibberish are quite different from anything I've seen or read, as though written by someone driven by madness or some other motive to undermine any attempt to make sense of this world. Along with the notes I found illustrations and survivor statements from police files and thousands of short stories in a dark chamber in the basement. They had been piled up and set ablaze but quickly extinguished with some sort of a putrid, rotting sludge. I cleaned the chamber and stacked all the stories in piles to go through and organize at a later date. For the time being I see no reason to remove them from what I am now calling the Chamber of Blood."
SURVIVOR STATEMENT. SEAN DINT.,Tome06_Observer,"I was listening to a podcast of creepy stories with my friends… Adrien… Mia… Tina… and Bill. I can't remember which one of us figured how to do it… but we realized that the stories were codes to pass on coordinates of locations of interest for some group or cult or whatever. We decoded a few other stories and came to the conclusion that these people were sending encrypted locations of places where they believe there would be ghosts. We didn't buy any of that paranormal crap and we were just having fun drinking and decoding the stories and looking up the places on satellite maps. But when the coordinates of one story turned out to be close to us, we thought we could check out the place for fun. Adrien rented a car and we headed up to what was left of the crumbling asylum. There was nothing but overgrown ruins. But I remember this unnatural black fog and it was like we were at the asylum but some other version of it. It was really strange. And that's when we saw this thing… this giant samurai with a demon mask lurking about as though it had stepped out of one world and into another. He killed Mia first. I don't remember what happened exactly… I just saw… I saw her head thump and tumble across the ground. I don't remember much… I remember crawling out of the fog and that demon or apparition or whatever that thing was couldn't follow me… like it was blocked by something invisible. Not long after a man who called himself Hans and who identified himself as a detective arrived and asked me questions about what I had seen. He took some notes and seemed a bit strange. Then when he heard the sirens approaching, he disappeared just like that. When the police arrived, the fog was gone leaving only the… the… hacked remains of my friends. And now I'm here… and you're telling that you don't know who that detective was and that you want me to show you how to crack the code of the podcast. But I can't because I don't know! That was my buddy Tina, and she's hacked to pieces you assholes!"

Evil Eyes 1,Tome06_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 1.<br><br>Haddie Kaur lifted her chai tea, let the steaming, spicy cardamom and cinnamon elixir sooth down her throat, and set down her stainless-steel cup in the small dhaba near her ancestral village of Mohi. The tea warmed her insides, yet she shivered cold with a nameless terror that mocked and poked at her like a formless apparition, reminding her that all wasn't what it seemed and that there were nameless things that went bump in the night.<br><br>Ever since Haddie could remember she had seen and heard things beyond the veil, and she even had vague recollections of the day her parents disappeared while they were vacationing when she was five years old. She remembered the whispers, the approaching darkness, and the sense that somehow they were in another reality. She didn't remember much about that time, but she remembered being taken in by her French-Canadian godparents, the Rois, who raised her with their son, Jordan.<br><br>Now Haddie and her older stepbrother Jordan were in India, filming episodes for their fairly successful web series 'Harbinger of Hell' with their uncle Stefan. A fan had sought them out after having watched one of their episodes about interdimensional overlaps which Haddie could sense, feel and even explore if her focus was right and she was able to 'tune in' as she so often described her process.<br><br>As their luck would have it this mysterious benefactor had funded an entire expedition all over the world, giving her brother and uncle access to countless remote and classified areas of known paranormal activity and unexplainable disappearances.<br><br>Haddie sipped her tea, listening to the villagers speak a language that reminded her of her disappeared father, and she suddenly heard a familiar voice and Quebecois accent that stood out from the rest calling out her name.<br><br>A moment later Stefan entered the dhaba with Jordan. “I found the site of the massacre,” Stefan said. “Finish your tea, and let's get outta here!”<br><br>Haddie sprang to her feet and followed her uncle and brother into the scorching hot day."
Evil Eyes 2,Tome06_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 2.<br><br>“The thugs were ambushed in the valley near the ruins of the old signaling fort,” a turbaned man with a beard said. “I'm not sure what you hope to find here. Most stay away from this place like the plague.” He stared at the older teens as if they were mad. “You should have returned to the hotel like your uncle. Nothing here but the eyes, and they're probably watching us right now.”<br><br>Haddie and Jordan didn't answer or want to explain that their uncle didn't have the stomach for adventure, that he was more of a producer and that he was trying to finish off a horror novel he'd been working on for the last ten years. Ignoring the guide's nervous ramblings, Haddie studied the white stone bricks of the ruined fort and the surrounding caves with a strange feeling that they were being watched.<br><br>The guide said, “The official story is a unit of British soldiers died fighting a band of thugees.”<br><br>“And the unofficial story?” Haddie turned to him. The guide stared at her for a long moment. “The unofficial story is they turned their rifles and swords against each other. Something in these caves drove them mad.”<br><br>Haddie absorbed this and closed her eyes while Jordan filmed the ruins and the caves. Calming her heart and silencing her mind, she began to hear the rising screams and cries of people being butchered. When she opened her eyes again, she could see the scintillating orange residual memories of British soldiers cutting down thuggee rebels.<br><br>One thug seemed to be holding something important in his hands as he escaped the massacre. She walked through residual memories and approached the thug, starring at a piece of broken pillar in his hand. The thug desperately clambered over the rocks and rubble, charging into a nearby cave with the soldiers in hot pursuit.<br><br>Jordan stepped up behind her. “Did you see anything?”<br><br>Haddie nodded and pointed at the cave the thug had run into.<br><br>The guide raised his eyebrows. “And that's my cue to go,” he said, turning his back on the siblings. “Not that I think you're both crazy… which I do… but I need to get home before my wife realizes I'm gone. It's my day to make rotis and pick up the kids from school.”<br><br>Haddie and Jordan watched the guide disappear down the rocky, sun-baked valley. Then they turned and approached the gaping mouth of the cave. For a long moment they stared into the darkness without saying a word. Jordan turned on the flashlight of his cellphone and just as they prepared to enter, they heard the crunch of stone behind them. Brother and sister turned slowly to face the barrel of a rifle."
Evil Eyes 3,Tome06_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 3.<br><br>Three men speaking an ancient, unknown language forced Haddie and Jordan through the dark and seemingly endless cave with flickering flashlights to illuminate the way. Somehow these captors knew Haddie had a gift and were barking orders for her in broken English to lead them to the place where the thuggee rebel had hidden the relic. She didn't recognize her captors but it wasn't the first time someone had forced her to find something with her special abilities.<br><br>Haddie followed a trail of residual memories—memories and whispers only she could see and hear. She could sense they were walking through an 'overlap' of realities which heightened and reinforced her abilities in an inexplicable way. She followed the scintillating orange trail and froze when the residual soldiers suddenly disappeared. Then she started when the soldiers blinked back into existence and she heard desperate screams as something she couldn't make out attacked them.<br><br>“What is it?” one of her captors asked.<br><br>“She's seeing something,” Jordan said. “Let her do her thing.”<br><br>“This better not be a trick!”<br><br>Haddie watched the indiscernible creature rip the soldiers into an unrecognizable mess of flesh and gore. The creature then snatched the thug and dragged him screaming through a series of interconnecting tunnels. She chased after the fading memory, entering a small cavern as she watched the thug release the relic as the creature dragged him into a smaller tunnel that she imagined led to a feeding den.<br><br>Memories burned out like dying embers to reveal a cavern of human bones piled over thick rotting sludge. She winced at the stench of fermented organs and fluids and waved a cloud of flies away from her face. Near one pile of bones was a corpse, still warm, flayed from head to toe, eyes missing, mouth transfixed in an agonizing scream. The captors stared at the corpse for a long moment before one prodded Haddie with the barrel of his rifle.<br><br>“What the hell did this?” One of their captors murmured in disbelief.<br><br>“There must be a bend in reality here.” Another captor offered as an explanation. Haddie noted that what she called an 'overlap' these men called a 'bend.' It was clear that they had an understanding of other dimensions and that somehow this piece of column was more than just a relic.<br><br>“Where is it?” The leader prodded Haddie. “Where's the relic!”<br><br>Haddie took a moment, then pointed at a pile of bones. “But it could also be in there…” She motioned toward the tunnel that led to the feeding den.<br><br>“Check the bones,” one captor ordered the siblings.<br><br>Jordan and Haddie kneeled in the sticky sludge and rummaged through the bones as the leader turned toward the shadowy tunnel. He inched close to the opening and flashed a blade of light inside. While the other two captors were dealing with flies and covering their noses, Haddie found the jagged piece of column and stealthily slid it over to Jordan.<br><br>A sudden chatter of teeth and hissing made them all turn to the leader. He searched the darkness with a beam of light that suddenly momentary revealed a grotesque creature with a face covered by dozens if not hundreds of glowing red eyes.<br><br>The leader brought the beam back to the face as the creature hissed and revealed a mouth filled with needle-like teeth. An instant later the creature grabbed the flashlight and pulled the leader inside the den.<br><br>The other captors stumbled, dropped things and fired stupidly into the darkness. Haddie instantly grabbed a fallen flashlight, looked at her brother with wide, desperate eyes and yelled for him to—<br><br>“RUN!”"
Evil Eyes 4,Tome06_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 4.<br><br>Jordan and Haddie rushed through the cave with the screams and cries of dying brutes echoing through the bowels of the mountain. “What was that thing?”<br><br>“I didn't get a good look and I don't really want to!” Haddie yelled and she could see the sunlight ahead but sensed they wouldn't make it. “Keep going!” She yelled and turned to face the darkness with only a flashlight.<br><br>The hissing and crumbling faded to silence. She had no idea what she was going to do next. She narrowed her gaze, waiting. Teeth suddenly chattered and a hundred red eyes bore down on her.<br><br>Haddie inched back and fell to the ground beside a skeleton holding a kukri in one hand and a revolver in the other. She instantly wrenched the weapons out of its boney hands and clambered to trembling feet.<br><br>The creature approached slowly, hissing and chattering, its terrible eyes fixated on her. She stared at long arms and fingers with claws like knives. She lifted her arm and aimed the revolver at its head. Then she pulled the trigger and—<br><br>Nothing happened.<br><br>A hundred eyes stared down at the revolver, then back at her.<br><br>“Shit.”<br><br>The creature hissed, then attacked with a roar. Haddie evaded. Terrible claws swished overhead and hit the wall. Bits of rock and stone rained over her.<br><br>Covered in debris, she sprang up and ran with the creature in pursuit. She turned in the gathering dust and instinctively felt the attack before it came as she often did. With one quick thrust of her arm, the blade of the kukri severed the hand. The creature shrieked something terrible.<br><br>Haddie seized the opportunity to severe the head but the creature lunged away and the blade hit the stone wall. The kukri vibrated out of her hand and she dove to the ground as the creature charged her.<br><br>Tumbling away, Haddie instinctively grabbed a slab of stone. The creature attacked and missed, hitting the wall. Without hesitation Haddie smashed the slab over its bewildered head with a terrible crunching sound she wouldn't soon forget.<br><br>The creature collapsed and Haddie, adrenalin rushing, bludgeoned the head and eyes. When there was nothing left but a sticky, warm pulp she released the gore-covered stone and fell back on her haunches to gather herself. But no sooner did she relax than she heard the rising crescendo of chattering teeth echoing through the darkness.<br><br>With an almost defeated sigh, Haddie staggered to her feet. White fear flashed through her mind as the chattering and hissing grew louder and louder. Teeth clenched as thousands of red eyes flared up in the inky blackness of the cave. She backed away slowly, then spun on her heals and ran!"
Evil Eyes 5,Tome06_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Evil Eyes. 5.<br><br>Haddie charged toward the mouth of the cave with millions of eyes and chattering teeth on her heels. She felt the swipes at her back but never wavered. She vaulted wildly out the mouth just as one creature lunged at her. Haddie tumbled out of the cave as the creature hit an invisible barrier where the overlap of dimensions ended. She turned to see the dark mouth of the cave fill with scathing red eyes.<br><br>Jordan stepped up behind her. “Helly Haddie, does it again,” he said with a laugh.<br><br>Haddie gave her brother a dirty look. “Don't call me that,” she said curtly. Even though he had meant no harm, it was a name along with 'The Harbinger of Hell' children used to call her because bad luck, strange things and unexplainable accidents seemed to follow her. Years of therapy gave her the courage to accept her abilities and to boldly call her series the Harbinger of Hell.<br><br>Exhausted, Haddie sat on a sun-baked stone and watched the red eyes slowly disappear from the gloom of the cave. “Did you catch the creature on your shirt cam?”<br><br>Jordan shook his head as he sat beside her. She didn't think he would as creatures or relics from other worlds didn't register and often left blurs or glitches.<br><br>Jordan sighed and handed over the relic they had recovered. “What do you make of it?”<br><br>Haddie held it and felt great misery. In her mind's eye she saw cloaked figures hiding pieces of the same pillar in another world. She shrugged and kept what she had seen to herself. Then she pulled out her cellphone and handed it to Jordan. He centered her in the frame and indicated he was filming.<br><br>Haddie cleared her throat, mopped her forehead of sweat and soot, looked into the lens, and proceeded to address her online followers:<br><br>“My name is Haddie and I was born with a wonderful curse. All my life I've attracted strange and unusual things, and when I was twelve, I realized I was able to acquire insight to unexplainable events and otherworldly places.”<br><br>She took a moment to calm her racing heart. She swallowed her fear, remembered she had a series to sell, and forced energy and pep into her voice. “What do you need to know about India? It's where my father grew up and it's where I am today to explore the urban legends of this amazing country.”<br><br>Haddie took a moment to find her words.<br><br>“Our adventure begins in Northern India at a strange place locals call The Eyes or the Valley of Evil Eyes where hundreds have disappeared or died including a unit of British soldiers in the 1800s. What happened to these soldiers? Where did they disappear to? And is there any merit to the accounts of a cave-dwelling demon with eyes around its head that burn right through the soul?”<br><br>Haddie stared meditatively into the camera and wanted to say 'yes' to every one of her questions but decided it was better to leave them up to interpretation. After a dramatic pause, she finished, “Take a look at what we discovered. Judge the evidence for yourself… and see if there is any truth to the Evil Eyes of the Himalayas.”"
MEMORY 369,Tome06_Yui,"An engine echoes through the darkness. A roar vibrates through Yui's body as she accelerates through a thick churning fog across a wasteland of crumbling pagodas and buildings. She passes a wrecked motorcycle on the side of the road. Not far from the bike a rider tries to stand but collapses on a shattered leg. She can't stop. She won't stop. She needs to win. She needs to reach the… she's not sure anymore… She looks left and right as she zips past the ruins of her hometown. She passes the same rider again trying to escape the blazing wreck. Doesn't make any sense. Nothing makes sense. A demon yells in the fog. Seems like he's right behind her, lurking in the fog, waiting to jump out at her. She maneuvers through piles of flesh and gore of fallen riders burning and sending puffs of swirling smoke up into the darkness. She yells helplessly and the dead, smoldering riders begin to evaporate into a column of light breaking through the darkness. A rider suddenly stands in front of her. She skids, loses control, and tumbles over the road. Her insides feel like mush. Things are broken everywhere. Cracked bones rip through her skin, spitting out black, warm fluid. She tries to rise but a bone jutting out of her black jeans won't let her stand. Like the fallen rider she ignored, she's broken, helpless and soaked in gasoline."
MEMORY 378,Tome06_Yui,"Engines rattle and roar in an endless cacophony as Shinji messes with Yui. Everyone wants the jackpot, and she needs this money more than ever. She's been working as an assistant English teacher at a high school but it's barely enough to get by let alone fix her bike. Her bike… her bike feels sick. She used to love the sound of her bike but recently she's noticed a change, a few notes are off, and the sound just doesn't travel through her body the way it used to. All these engines singing their unique song and her bike singing something strange and off. She needs the prize money, and the sponsorship of a billionaire wouldn't be so bad either. Last thing she'll do is let this fool disrupt her focus. She smiles at him after he levels an insult at her and threatens to run her off the road. Yui meets his gaze. You'll try, but you'll crash and burn just as soon as you do. She says it with the weight and certainty of a curse. Shinji tells her she should stay out of this one and let the men race. She knows what he trying to do. He's trying to disrupt her. Get in her head. Change the vision of victory in her mind. He tells her the race is his. She flashes a smile. Not while I'm alive."
MEMORY 370,Tome06_Yui,"Misato studies Yui closely. To dream of fog and darkness means you see yourself as an imposter… perhaps even a failure. Yui nods and absorbs her friend's interpretation. Misato sips her beer. To see light means you'll overcome whatever is holding you back. To dream of a crash or a dead end could mean the death of something you want… something you wish for. Yui sighs and doesn't know if she wants to hear all this. The demon? The Oni? Why was it chasing me? Misato nods. The Oni could mean you're struggling to maintain your humanity as you chase your dreams, that you may be torn between right and wrong, between good and evil. Misato laughs to herself as she finishes her beer. Maybe winning isn' t everything. Maybe you're greedy. Maybe you're trying to swallow an ocean when a glass of water would suffice. Yui scoffs. Greedy? I'm broke and you're paying for the beers! Misato shakes a drunken finger at her. Greed isn't just about money, Yui. It's about wanting more of anything. More races. More trophies. More fame. Maybe your need to prove yourself is killing something in you that doesn't want to die. Yui sighs and downs her beer. Enough stupid talk and more drinking. Behind her dismissive smile Yui believes her nightmare has nothing to do with ego or greed, but the anxiety of not having the money to pursue her dream."
MEMORY 371,Tome06_Yui,"Maybe winning isn't everything… Might not be everything but it is rent money and groceries and beer for the next few weeks if she wins the Secret4. But before she can win, she must be given a chance to race. Shinji the favorite has found a way to keep Yui out of the race, convincing the organizers that a female racer would undermine the Secret4. It's chauvinistic. Barbaric. Dated. But it's also her reality. They're not used to someone of her calibre. Calibre? Shinji has no calibre. He cheats and humiliates and ridicules to get a psychological edge. She knows his game, and he knows he's going to have to race her one of these days. But for now, he tells them if she races, he won't, and since he's the current champ, they somehow believe they need him to attract the money. She's sitting out tomorrow's race. But she'll be there to cheer her good friend Hiro."
MEMORY 372,Tome06_Yui,"Shinji trash talks Yui as she fills Hiro's ears with fighting words. Fighting words… That's what her grandmother used to call them. Words with wings that filled the mind and lifted the spirit. Words… words are more than words. They can build. They can destroy. They can empower. They can turn mice into gods and gods into mice. Shinji tells Hiro he's going to make an example out of him because he supports Yui. Hiro acts tough but Yui sees those fear heavy words crawling into his ear, feasting on his confidence and weighing him down. Shinji turns to Yui and makes fun of her hair, winks at her, and asks if she came to watch men ride. She doesn't dignify his shit with a comeback. She wants Hiro to win, but the termites have taken hold, and he's a shell of a rider on a bike about to crack. She whispers winning words in his ears like her grandmother used to do with her. But he doesn't know how to make those words work for him. He's lost and the race hasn't even begun yet."
MEMORY 373,Tome06_Yui,"4 AM. Yui watches Hiro speed off and take the lead. Shinji and others follow close behind. Maybe her words did help. Hiro rounds the bend. She watches Shinji race beside him and lean in. He leans in close, extends his arm, and touches Hiro's shoulder. Just touches him. Not to push him or hurt him but to annoy him. To distract him. Hiro swears. Loses his focus. Loses control. An instant later he's skidding across with pavement with a wrecked bike leaving a trail of sparks and oil. His helmet is disintegrating layer by layer against the rough pavement like sandpaper. He needs help, but the other racers speed past him all trying to win the prize money. Hiro stands and staggers stupidly into the road. His helmet doesn't exist anymore, and his face has been razed to the bone. His mouth and lips are gone. There're just teeth where lips used to be. A shriek sends a shiver of fear up her spine as a car slams on the breaks, loses control and hits her good friend."
MEMORY 374,Tome06_Yui,"Yui accelerates through the fog with a red-eyed demon chasing her. She skids out of control, breaks her legs, and drags herself helplessly through the fog. Footfalls thunder toward her, shaking the ground with every step. She looks over her shoulder but all she sees is the thickening fog. A boot crushes her hand. She looks up to face--herself. Yui awakens in a hospital by Hiro covered in bandages with tubes sticking out of him. Authorities don't know it was an illegal race. If they did, they'd all end up in jail. She's not sure if Hiro can understand her but she tries her best to comfort him. Doctor says you're lucky to be alive. She wants to tell him he'll never walk again but she can't bring herself to do it. She doesn't say anything. She can't say anything. One lapse in judgement and he lost everything. Could happen to anyone. Yui closes her eyes and for a moment imagines a world where she hunts that bastard down and kills him like a dog."
MEMORY 375,Tome06_Yui,Misato delivers some good news while they walk toward their favorite noodle dive. The organizers want her to race the Secret4. An unknown benefactor wants to see what she can do. Rumors echo of a billionaire wanting to help lifers realize their dreams. None of it makes sense. Yui feels many things right now but an overpowering need to put Shinji in his place distracts her. But she knows she must put the mental lens of her focus on winning. Not payback. Not vengeance. Not even gossip or trash talk. Everything on winning. Not just to impress an eccentric billionaire but to pay the rent and grocery bills.
MEMORY 376,Tome06_Yui,"Yui walks up a mountain path she recognizes and sees a woman standing at the edge of a precipice. She reaches out to the woman. Knows something's wrong. The woman turns to her slightly and Yui realizes she's staring at an older version of herself. Grey hair, bloodshot eyes, tears streaming down her face. Older Yui stares at younger Yui with longing. Then older Yui shakes her head, turns and jumps. Younger Yui rushes to the edge and stares down at countless bodies busted and broken over jagged rocks. All of them… her. She has sudden flashes of a life she doesn't recognize, a life where she never left Hida or pursued her dream. A life where she became a teacher like her father. None of it makes sense. She covers her face with her young hands and screams and suddenly wakes up in her bed lying in a pool of sticky, cold sweat."
MEMORY 377,Tome06_Yui,"Misato smiles at Yui. Maybe it wasn't a dream. Maybe it was a glimpse into another world, a world where you take a completely different path. In one you become a vengeful, red-eyed brute and in another a coward that doesn't follow her dreams. Yui shakes her head. I don't believe in any of that multi-world magical bullshit. Misato scrunches her face when she hears magic. Not magic, quantum… quantum bullshit. Misato munches on peanuts and sips her beer. If it's a dream it probably has something to do with something you are moving away from, something you left behind. What do the cliffs signify? Yui remembers a moment with her grandmother. She remembers she was at a recreational center with her friends and cousins. She lost a relay race because her best friend stopped to see if their competitor was okay when he tripped and fell. Her teammate helped the boy up while another team took the lead and won the race. She was furious and they hadn't spoken for weeks. Yui remembered going to the precipice where they liked to talk hoping she would be there, but she wasn't. Her grandmother went up to see her and listened to her side of the story and sided with her friend.<br><br>Yui vaguely remembered the talk. Her grandmother sat beside her, staring below at the jagged rocks, laughing nervously. You love danger… and more than danger you love winning. Always have, always will. But winning isn't everything, Yui. Tell me… what's the use of winning if you lose all your friends? Who are you going to share your victories with? Yui laughs at this and calls her best friend weak. Her grandmother places a concerned hand on her shoulder. She's not weak. I would say she's quite the opposite to sacrifice winning to help someone in need. Empathy is what makes us human and if you lose this you are… you are just a very good machine that wins. What does it matter if you gain the world if you lose your humanity? Yui closes her eyes and knows her grandmother is right, and yet… there's something inside her that hates to lose, that refuses to lose, something that will drive her to win despite it all. A thing that brings out the best and worst in her."

Everything's a blur, nothing makes sense, and his veins are still pumping with a tingling concoction of anesthesia and adrenalin. Feels like Nam all over again. One minute you're drifting off to some faraway dreamland, the next you're fighting off the surgeon in a strange, foggy, half-nightmare. He remembers seeing the nurse, twitching, convulsing, changing. Changing into something he didn't quite understand and still doesn't even though they're everywhere. He remembers sensing something was off. Way off. He remembers his gut churning, twisting, fighting against the weight of his eyelids, trying his best to keep them open as bloody hell erupted all around him. He remembers falling to the ground with the nurse, the tray clattering, the knives and tools scattering. He wanted to sleep, just sleep, but he ordered his eyes to stay open and spotted the syringe rolling over the antiseptic floor. He remembers jerking his arm out, grabbing the syringe and smashing it into his heart. Or was it his arm? Or maybe both? He doesn't remember anymore. Doesn't matter. All that matters is he made it out of that hell alive. He shakes his throbbing head and clambers over a barricade blocking an alley. Winds his way through the burning city toward the market. Most of the city has been reduced to shit. Smoke and fumes seep through the streets. The air reeks of burning civilization. Burning humanity. He recognizes the smell. Brings him back to places he'd rather forget. Emergency sirens keen endlessly over the echoing shrieks of the infected. Flames erupt from the ruins and barricades making Philly look like a smoldering wasteland of death and destruction. He had read articles about the so-called green flu. It had only been a few days and it already felt like it was bringing us all back to the goddamn Stone Age. This is worse than Nam. Way worse. Philly in chaos and overrun by the infected. It was more than a common flu. No kidding. Dozens of conspiracy theories and now it doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter. All that matters is surviving. Been here before. Many times. He hears someone shout out a curse and spots a young woman clobbering an infected hoard by the market entrance with a rake. Impressive. Up and at em, soldier! Mind if I cut in. They slash through the infected until all that's left is writhing flesh and gore. He stares at her. She approaches him. Not bad, old man. Name's Zoey, last woman on Earth. Not really but it feels like it. She laughs and wipes chunks of putrid flesh off her arm. She reminds him of a kid he knew in Nam. Strong smile and beaucoup funny… beaucoup fierce… just like her."
Memory 777,Tome07_Bill,"Hello! Anyone out there! I need a hand over here! Bill hears the cries for help above the agonizing groans of the infected. He spots a cage in the middle of all the chaos surrounded by the infected. He grabs his rifle and fires, splitting infected heads like watermelons. He approaches the cage with Zoey where he sees a man covered in blood. Out of the frying pan and into the cage. He laughs to himself. How'd you end up in this shit hole of a thing? The man sighs. Quit yapping and get me out. Zoey looks around. Something ain't right about this. She's got good instinct. Bill's feeling the same knot in his belly. The man smashes the cage. Just get me out of here before they come back! Bill lifts the butt of his rifle and smashes the padlock off the latch with a mighty clang. Merry Christmas, kid. The man smirks. I like that one, gramps, and I ain't a kid. Call me Francis. Francis steps out of the cage repeating… Merry Christmas… Merry bloody Christmas… Bill spits over an infected corpse sprawled over the rubble. That's my line. Find your own. Francis' smile grows. No copyright on a line like that. Bill knows what he's doing. They're kind of a pack and this ain't about a line. This is about who's calling the shots. A lot of brass for a civilian. Truth is no one is really in charge in this shitstorm and we all gotta take the lead in some way or another and he's too stupid to understand. He oughtta break him now before things get stupid. Set him straight. He inches closer to the man. Zoey sighs. Boys… it's just a goddamn line. A sudden clicking sound behind them and Bill senses they're screwed. They turn to face three men with guns trained on them. Out of the cage and into the blazing, goddamn fire. Francis sighs. Shit… Canadians. Bill looks'em over. A group of men in make-shift hazmat suits and rifles. We ain't Canadians, now move! Bill looks to Zoey and Francis and goes sotto-voce. They're survivalists. Francis scrunches his face. So what are you saying… you saying they're worse than Canadians? Bill doesn't know how to respond to this. He fought with Canadians. Damn good soldiers. What's your beef with Canadians? Francis shrugs. What isn't"
Memory 778,Tome07_Bill,"An idiot prods Bill into a room with some kind of make-shift electric poker. Watch that thing CEDA! The idiot prods him. We ain't CEDA. He pushes Bill into the corner with Francis and Zoey. He sees they got a geek on a computer. They're telling him to hack into the machine but he's telling them he can't. He's tech-savvy but he ain't no hacker. After a few tries they push him aside. They call him boy. He says his name is Louis, not boy and that gets him a gun shoved in his face. Geek has spunk and attitude. The survivalists talk amongst themselves. One of them sits in front of the laptop and hacks his way in. Bill overhears bits and parts. Search the computer for the locations of the safehouses. The flu took hold faster than anyone expected. Those who prepared the safehouses turned before they could use them. These assholes are mapping a path through the city using the safehouses as checkpoints like the old underground railway. Fitting for Philadelphia. They probably got hundreds of ideas on how they're going to use us. One of them grabs Zoey and has his own idea. Bill jackknifes to her side despite his restraints. Get your filthy mitts off her. The brute inches up to her and she gives him a kick he ain't ever gonna forget. Bill didn't think anyone could scream like that. He stares at Zoey with wide approving eyes. The brute continues to scream something terrible and collapses to his knees holding his gonads. His buddy rushes to his aid. Helps the screaming man up but… he looks different… real different… something in his eyes. Or rather something lacking in his eyes. Shit. Louis leaps back from the man like he were the plague. Francis panics. Get us out of this. Louis grabs a knife from the floor and frees Bill as the survivalists turn pale. Screams and yells echo around them as Bill frees Zoey and Louis frees Francis. They step back. Zoey gasps. What do we do? Bill shrugs and sighs. Nothing we can do for them. An infected suddenly charges Zoey. Francis clubs its head off. Merry Christmas! He looks to Bill for a reaction. Bill shakes his head and seems unimpressed. Find your own line, kid, if you've got the grey matter to do so. Francis scoffs. Louis adjusts his tie. Francis makes a face and nudges Louis. Lose the tie… Lose the god damn tie. Louis ignores him. Zoey motions for the boys to shut the hell up and follow her. Let's find an Island where we can rot on and then fight over ties. Bill raises an inspired eyebrow. That sounds like a plan. He actually likes the idea of rotting an island while the world goes to hell. Kid's right! Grab some gear and let's get outta here!"
Memory 779,Tome07_Bill,"Bill leads the ragtags as he calls them through a city he doesn't recognize anymore. It's crazy how fast the flu changed everything. Change. It's the one thing that never surprised him. The one constant in his life. Change and surviving in the new normal. But this new normal… could take some getting used to. Ain't like they're gonna tear each other apart, apologize, then be friends again. He stares into the gloom and goes over the last few hours of his life in his mind. He didn't catch anything. They didn't catch anything and by all accounts they should have. Then it dawns on him… they're immune… they're asymptomatic. Ticking bombs just waiting to spread the flu. I brought the flu to them. Poor bastards. Louis steps up beside Bill. What now, Pops? Bill contorts his face. Don't call me pops. Old Man I don't mind, but not Pops. Bill marches on. I tell you 'what now'… Now we find a safehouse and get some rest. But not before you punch Francis in the mouth for talking more shit than a sewer. Bill laughs. I'm messing, kid, but I see you getting pissed with all the tie jokes. Don't let him get to you. His way to cope with all this shit. I knew guys like him in Nam. They're just scared to die and distracting themselves by messin' around with others. But what really gets me is he stole my goddamn line. Louis laughs. Bill doesn't find it very funny. I know, I know… Imitation is the sincerest form of compliment. But that civilian using my line. That just ain't right to me."
Memory 780,Tome07_Bill,"Safehouses are abandoned but they're still treasure troves of supplies. This beast of a flu hit fast and took no prisoners. Bill sighs and doubts evacuations are still running counter to Zoey's belief that the government actually still gives a shit. World has gone to hell and the government don't care but he ain't saying anything. Last thing he'll do is rob them of hope as they creep through the bowels of the fallen city. He liked Zoey's other idea about finding an island to rot on. That was a good idea. If you're gonna rot anywhere, an island, any island, ain't half a bad idea. Especially one with coconuts. But if she wants to hope for the government she can go right ahead. He ain't gonna take away her hope. Even if he knows enough about the government to know they ain't worth a second thought let alone a second chance. But he'll shut up for a civilian that still believes in the system… a system that was broken long before the flu spread. Besides, while she hopes for the government he'll figure something out. He always does. Zoey regards him. There's gotta be more like us… areas that have be protected… quarantined. It can't be that all cities are like this. Bill supresses a cynical remark. There's something in Zoey he respects. She reminds him of someone he used to know. Someone he used to be. Someone who had all kinds of ideas and ideals before he had seen the true face of governments… of humanity… it's nice to see that in her. Real nice. He hopes it lasts and this hell doesn't stamp it out of her. A heavy wind moans dreadfully and carries with it an all too familiar smell… the smell of rot… the smell of filth… the smell of death. The infected. Dozens of them. Maybe hundreds. Bill acts on instinct. Eyes open! Guns ready! Before he can say another word the infected close in on them. Gunshots clap through the dead city. Heads crack open like rotten, festering melons and the infected lay strewn all around them. One lashes out of the shadows toward Bill. Without hesitation Francis blows its face off and turns to him. Merry Christmas! Bill sighs deeply. Bastard saved my life and now he's trying to rub it in my face. He gives Francis a stern, grizzled look. Alright… the line's yours, now shut the hell up and shoot! Bill curses under his breath and continues to shoot dark silhouettes charging through the deep, orange dusk. Damn, I missed this."
Arcus 03,Tome07_Observer,"Spent the entire day doing unnecessary, mundane tasks like sweeping the floor, dusting statues and furniture, and polishing silverware all in a fairly successful attempt to keep my mind busy.  I imagine once I have the Auris working as it should be, I'll be able to keep myself distracted with was seems to be dreaming black fog. Toward the evening, I tinkered with the Auris, and when this proved frustrating, I worked out mathematical equations and theories while talking to myself and engaging in stimulating debate and what I believed to be meaningful discourse. One of the lessons of those on assignment within the boundaries of an Ancient is to keep to a rigorous routine of writing, reading and self-talk to not let the pillars of the intellect crumble under the weight of laziness, alienation and boredom. Thinking and speaking are skills, and like any skill, they can decay and wither away if not practiced regularly."
Chamber of Blood. Ole Bloody.,Tome07_Observer,"This is the story the tour guide told us after showing us around the old Mad Canyon Distillery in Moonlight Bay. She offered the adults a taste of Ole Bloody, a recipe that had been infamous during prohibition. While we tasted the bathtub gin, no one spoke as the firewater burned down our throats. The tour guide talked about the abandoned distillery we were walking through, telling us about how the first gang had all but disappeared before the legendary Al Capone got his hands on the operation. She must have told the story often as she spoke fluidly and made gestures and pauses at all the right moments.<br><br>""Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm not one for tall tales but what we know of the disappearance of the Maddy Hatter Gang is very much a vampire story if ever I heard one. The Maddy Hatter Gang was mostly made up of the Maddock family led by the father Hank who had a thing about collecting hats from the rival gang members he butchered. He must have stolen the wrong hat because that bloodlust came back to haunt him in the fall of 1921 when his gang disappeared with only the youngest of the family left to tell the tale of what had befallen them. And what had befallen them was indeed a great mystery. A mystery people to this day bicker about and dismiss as an urban legend. But I swear it's no legend and all of it is the truth.<br><br>""The twins Candice and Coddy, while returning with some equipment they had picked up in Ontario, drove into the valley and then carried the copper tubing and flasks into the caves where the gang prepared their white lightning. But when they arrived they found nothing but blood. Blood on the floor. Blood on the walls. Blood, if you'll believe it, running through the tubes and coils of the still. At first, they thought it may have been a rival gang. But there was no sign of bullets or bodies or even a struggle—just blood and an uncanny fog that hung low and heavy in the air.<br><br>""The twins instantly resolved to find whoever had done this to their gang and moreover they wanted to give their siblings, cousins and parents a proper burial. So they grabbed a lantern and plunged into the twisting bowels of the mountain, following a trail of blood. They searched deep into the night with no result. Coddy shone the lantern and was just about to tell his sister he was beaten when he heard the crunch of stone in the distance. He charged ahead, and she chased after him, stumbling over a boulder, hitting her head against the ground and losing consciousness.<br><br>""When Candice roused, she sprang to her feet and rushed toward the flickering lantern light, screaming her brother's name. Through dancing shadow and light, she approached her pale brother sprawled over the ground with two small puncture wounds in his neck. She felt his chest for a pulse and gasped when she realized he was dead. She shuddered, then screamed, and moved by an unknown force, she grabbed the lantern and charged forward. Then, without realizing it, she entered a massive cavern, feeling the ground beneath her feet turn to mush.<br><br>""She shone her lantern around, revealing piles of human skulls amidst thousands of beetles moving through a thick sludge. At her feet, she saw a few beetles devouring a sick bat. She tensed and looked upward to see thousands of bats sleeping. A few beetles scurried over her foot with morsels of rotting flesh and she kicked them away. She swallowed her fear, realizing that if she woke the bats, they would strip her flesh clean in a matter of minutes. Then she glanced at familiar barrels in the corner by a pile of animal bones.<br><br>""Silently and carefully, she made her way past the bones. Opening the barrel, she cringed as a horrible stench assaulted her nose. She peered at the dark brew and wasn't sure what she was looking at. Then she realized she was staring at fermenting lumps of flesh in thick, putrid blood. She was in the vampire's lair. But before she could continue her search, a roar suddenly startled her.<br><br>""Candice turned and found herself staring at a demon with fangs with a swirling black fog rising at its feet. Through the fog, she saw it was wearing her father's hat. She gave a shout of revenge like thunder. The vampire twisted its ugly head in startled disbelief. Fearlessly, Candice threw herself at the vampire. She didn't care what this thing was or where it came from. She just wanted it dead, and she wanted to do her family proud. The vampire meant to kill her by sinking its fangs in her neck. But she felt strong enough to bring down a mountain.<br><br>""And so she jerked and kicked and pushed its snarling face. With a snarl of her own, she bit back at the vampire, tearing pale flesh off its neck with teeth and jaws strong enough to crush rock. Before the vampire realized what was happening, she gouged its eye with her thumb, ramming it deeper and deeper as it desperately clawed flesh off her arms and face. But she didn't care. She would not be denied, and within moments she felt the delicate brain matter like warm mud and smiled. Then she curled her finger and yanked as hard as she could with a mad laugh.<br><br>""With a shriek, the vampire convulsed violently, then stopped all at once, its jaws frozen in a twisted, agonized howl. Unable to control her growing laughter, she took back her father's hat and stood proudly as open wounds leaked and sputtered blood. Then the fog rolled over the vampire and somehow made it all disappear. The vampire. The bats. The beetles. The blood. Everything.<br><br>""Needless to say, no one believed Candice and she was put into an asylum to shut-up and wither away. But eventually, some rich philanthropist took charge of her, and she was never seen again.""<br><br>Everyone was silent. Someone laughed and said, ""That's not really a vampire story, is it?""<br><br>The tour guide replied, ""Not like we're used to, no. But that's her story and I swear I told it like I heard it.""<br><br>Then a young woman, in a concerned voice, added, ""I hope that girl ended up all right."""
Arcus 04,Tome07_Observer,"Stories and journals are scattered everywhere. So much to read… and yet I find myself drawn to the scribblings and renditions of the unknown creator I'm calling the Mad Designer. Journals filled with the wild sketches and musings of people I imagine are caught in other parts of this living dimension--people juxtaposed with other Terra worlds and timelines that make little or no sense to who they are or where they come from. The illustrations and notes are foolish, absurd and quite contradictory, and yet they bring moments of levity to my life which does the soul good. I suppose it's a form of absurd escapism I turn to when I'm not reading the more traditional stories. Interestingly enough, I found seventeen versions of a story featuring a killer named Evan written by seventeen versions of the same author from the omniverse. Seventeen similar stories with sometimes subtle, sometimes significant differences. What I find particularly interesting is how the stories are written as fiction in one world and non-fiction in another. It reminds me of Universus Alveo… a theory that suggests that the human mind might very well be equipped with a powerful networking mechanism that reaches out to other worlds for wisdom and knowledge from our other-selves. Some can use their minds in this way and others can't. The theory suggests that those who have experienced trauma in their formative years detach from their reality, allowing them to explore other realities and worlds with relative ease. Artists like magicians and shamans see small things in the big, unexplainable endless dream that is the omniverse and they bring these ideas or insights back to entertain, enlighten and inspire the world. Fiction in one world, non-fiction in another. Everything is real, or nothing is. And here in the Chamber of Blood there are countless horror stories of every variety. So many that it seems to me that one of the unknown prisoners was collecting these stories as a way to discover more about their imprisonment, the Entity and the terrible screams coming from the surrounding abyss. Whether this true or not, I'm not sure, but what I do know is I spent the whole night reading my favorite stories out loud like my father used to do by the fireplace. And the entire time I couldn't help but wonder… How? How could anyone have accessed and assembled such a rich collection of notes, journals and stories? I have no immediate answer, but I suspect by the texture and density of the fog that I may be in a place as complex, mysterious and misunderstood as a black hole—a living, breathing, all-consuming black hole, the serpent of infinity that gorges on its tail, that eats itself endlessly as it spirals downward into the cosmic, Fibonacci stew that is life incomprehensible."

I stared at them all day, recognizing a few of them from the last few memories I've been exploring.  It took me all night but I made a cairn with the heads outside the door. When I was done they began to talk and argue and bicker with each other over pedestrian nonsense.

Obscura. Beyond Understanding.,Tome07_Observer,"The tower is alive. I have memories of what the tower was the night before and it changes the next day. It changes in ways that defy reason or anything we've come to know about the ontology of these Ancients back home. It's entirely possible that if you were to understand all that this place is that you would go insane. I opened the door to what I thought would be an empty room covered in dust, only to discover an entire city with skyscrapers and ancient pagodas. Bewildered, I stared among the ruins of the street at a group of teenagers cutting down massive, mutant bug-like creatures with deadly samurai swords. I quickly closed the door and opened it again to find the city was gone. It had completely disappeared. Nothing there but a small dusty room with a strange-looking spider crawling toward me. I crushed the spider under the heel of my boot and didn't even attempt to understand what had just transpired."
Beneath the Ruins 1,Tome07_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 1.<br><br>Stefan sipped his cold Turkish coffee as he read over his early-morning efforts toward a short story he hoped to share on his blog. He read the opening lines and decided they could be stronger. With a sigh, he tore the yellow page from the legal pad, crumpled it into a ball and tossed it into a growing pile of false-starts in the middle of the opulent, black and burgundy hotel room. He slammed the desk, frustrated, and wanted to write something fun and original for his blog, yet nothing came to him. The latest episode sponsored by their mysterious benefactor had his production team investigate ancient tombs in South-West, Turkey. Not so much him. But his niece and nephew, who had tougher nerves for the macabre.<br><br>Stefan much preferred a safe and cozy hotel room where he could raid the mini-bar and see to the logistics of the show. It wasn't that he didn't like adventure. It was more that he didn't like graves, tombs or places that felt dark, creepy and dangerous. Haddie had once suggested that he wrote horror stories as a kind of therapy to work out his fears and anxieties of the unknown. She was half right. The other half was that he simply liked to be alone—alone with all the characters and voices chattering in his head, voices that demanded to be heard and set to paper.<br><br>Now the voices were compelling him to write a vampire story. Their benefactor claimed that there had been a village of real vampires in ancient Anatolia that had been hidden from the rest of the world. According to the intelligence provided, vampires weren't fictional monsters but actual intra-dimensional creatures that had once tried to overrun the world. They had been defeated by an unknown group of mystical warriors. Somehow the few creatures that had survived managed to erase themselves from history by warping and weaving whatever memory of them was left into exaggerated myths and legends.<br><br>Stefan found this theory of myths and legends and parallel worlds interesting if not intriguing.<br><br>Vampires real.<br><br>Actually, real.<br><br>Nothing like the movies, but real nevertheless.<br><br>One theory he had just finished reading online suggested that everything created or imagined existed somewhere in the 'Garden of Infinity.' In other words, stories and characters came from a real place in the infinite landscape that was the omniverse.<br><br>The theory went on to suggest that artists had somehow unlocked their third eye and were able to see into other realities. An idea, a vision, or a dream, according to the theory, was the pineal gland seeing into the infinite for truth, wisdom, inspiration. The brain, then, was a quantum computer that could network with the infinite. It was a nice idea. It meant that his most cherished characters from his favorite books… were somehow… somewhere… real. A sudden knock at the door startled him out of his quantum musings.<br><br>""Mr. Roi… Your lunch is ready.""<br><br>Lunchtime already and Stefan still didn't have his story. He rose lazily in his bathrobe, hoping Jordan and Haddie had better luck finding the unmarked graves they had set out to find. He imagined his niece and nephew were enjoying the sun while filming the ruins and enjoying the peanut butter and banana sandwiches he had prepared for them."
Beneath the Ruins 2,Tome07_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 2.<br><br>""Move away from the casket!"" A middle-aged woman with blonde hair and blue eyes dressed in a black suit pointed a revolver at Haddie and Jordan. Haddie dropped her shovel, sighed, exchange a look with her brother and stepped away from the bolted casket.<br><br>""Who do you work for?"" Haddie asked, eying the woman.<br><br>""That, my dear, does not concern you.""<br><br>Jordan shook his head. ""I don't think you should open it.""<br><br>""Shut-up!""<br><br>""My brother's right."" Haddie pointed at the symbols etched all in the rotten wood of the casket. ""It's a warning of some kind… whatever's in there… is meant to stay in there."" She scrutinized the half-crescent and three dots and wondered what they meant. They didn't resemble any of the other symbols she had come across in the last few months.<br><br>""Superstitious nonsense!"" The woman yelled, aimed the revolver at the bolt and pulled the trigger. A report echoed through the ruins and the surrounding forest.<br><br>Haddie wondered if their guide and translator had heard them. He probably didn't even take notice or didn't care. He refused to follow them near the tombs, called them ignorant tourists, and said he would stay by the car texting his friends until they returned. The woman pulled the trigger repeatedly until the bolt clanged off and hit the ground with a thud.<br><br>""I hope he calls the police,"" Jordan whispered to Haddie.<br><br>""I wouldn't count on it…""<br><br>The woman examined the casket carefully. Haddie and Jordan inched backward as she struggled to yank the lid open. As Haddie cautiously backed away, she figured the woman worked for the same secret society that had now interfered with several of her investigations.<br><br>She didn't know much about them, but from what she had gathered by overhearing a few of their goons in Egypt was that they were searching for hidden knowledge—knowledge they believed would help humanity transcend to another plane of existence.<br><br>""Please…"" Haddie cautioned. ""Don't open it until we know what the symbol means.""<br><br>The goon scoffed and, with a labored scream, yanked the lid open to reveal—<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>Nothing but a strange black mist.<br><br>""I don't understand,"" she said. ""It's supposed to be here… the book…""<br><br>The goon's eyes narrowed. Frustration creased her face as black mist suddenly rose and spiralled into her mouth and nose as though it were alive.<br><br>Haddie and Jordan stepped out of the grave.<br><br>The woman gagged, coughed and collapsed. There in the dirt, she jerked and twitched in all kinds of unnatural directions, screaming and shrieking as the mist reshaped her body into something indescribably grotesque. Her veins stood out thick and black in her neck. Her hands smashed the ground, and she went into hysteric convulsions as though being burned alive. Then, with a blood-curdling scream, her body went limp and silent.<br><br>Haddie repressed a cry of horror. She felt a cold prickle run down her spine as she stared at the scene in disbelief. What was going on? What strange mist could do such a thing to a person? Was it some kind of ancient poison… some kind of toxic vapor… or was it something worse…<br><br>""Well… you don't see that every day, do you?"" Jordan said flatly. ""I seriously wish I got that on my phone.""<br><br>Haddie sighed. ""Is she dead?""<br><br>""Dead as a tomb.""<br><br>Haddie didn't find him funny. Not in the least. He was scared. She could tell by his desperate attempt to use humor to hide his fear. He was just about to crack another joke when the creature suddenly twitched back to life.<br><br>Startled, Haddie gasped and pulled at Jordan's t-shirt, saying, ""We need to get out of here."" But just as she stepped back, the creature turned to face them with blood-red eyes and a jaw protruding like a snout with teeth that seemed to be growing underneath stretched skin.<br><br>""Oh shit!"" Haddie blurted. She lost her footing, and fell to the ground with her brother. The creature that had once been a woman roared at them, revealing two massive fangs like carving knives."
Beneath the Ruins 3,Tome07_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 3.<br><br>""This way!"" Haddie yelled, leading Jordan through the shadow and light spilling through the forest canopy. She could hear the creature shrieking as it hunted them with unnatural speed and resolve. Spotting an outcrop of jagged rocks, she quickly yanked her brother into hiding.<br><br>""Aren't vampires supposed to explode in sunlight?"" Jordan asked. ""I mean, isn't that what's supposed to happen!? Doesn't it know it's supposed to be dead?""<br><br>Haddie instantly placed a finger by his quivering lips as she heard footfalls approaching. She repressed an urge to look at the creature. Instead, she listened. She could hear the clattering and hissing coming from its hungry jaws. She could hear the crunch of stones and the distinct snap of twigs as the creature searched for them. Then the footfalls seemed to change direction, growing fainter and fainter until all she heard was the chirping of insects.<br><br>Haddie heaved a shuddering breath.<br><br>Jordan gulped and swallowed a lump in his throat, saying, ""We should have respected the warning.""<br><br>""If that's what it was… a warning…""<br><br>""What else could it be?""<br><br>""I don't know… What I do know is… we've released something foul into the world.""<br><br>""And by foul you mean the vampire and not gas,"" Jordan said with a smirk. ""Just clarifying.""<br><br>""Not funny.""<br><br>""A little funny.""<br><br>""No. Not even a little.""<br><br>Haddie risked moving beyond the rocks. She glanced apprehensively, half expecting the creature to hurl itself at them. When nothing happened, she stood and, slowly and quietly, led Jordan back toward their guide.<br><br>As she pushed her way through the woods, she couldn't help but notice the similarities between all the symbols she had seen at the last few investigation sites. They were unlike anything she had ever seen before and she had discovered them in completely different parts of the world. India. Africa. Portugal. England. Paris. And now… Turkey.<br><br>Haddie couldn't help but feel something was amiss. She broke the silence, saying, ""We're being pulled into something far more complex than we've been led to believe. Almost like… we're being used…""<br><br>""Used? For what? Who cares about a bunch of bozos from Montreal who release foul things into the world?""<br><br>Haddie shook her head, gave him a grave look and answered, ""I don't know. But I think it's about time we meet our mysterious—""<br><br>A twig snapped, startling the siblings.<br><br>Before Haddie could finish her thought, the creature stood framed between two trees, dappled in sunlight.<br><br>Jordan screamed in terror as the creature lunged at him, grabbing his arm and sinking its boney claws into his skin. With a mighty roar, the creature hurled him against a tree with a thud. Groaning, he sagged to the ground as inky blackness seeped down over his vision.<br><br>Haddie thought quickly, spotting a fallen branch on the ground.<br><br>The creature inched closer to Jordan, staring at him as though he were a steak. It kneeled before him and prepared to sink its fangs into Jordan's neck to satiate its red thirst. Just as it opened its gaping mouth, a resounding yell interrupted it.<br><br>The creature hissed and turned just in time to receive a branch across the face. It fell to the side, then scrambled to its feet, locking eyes with Haddie.<br><br>Haddie backed away slowly, glad she had saved her brother from certain doom, but unsure what would happen next. Then, inspired by the vampire films she had seen with her uncle Stefan, she turned the sharp side of the branch to face the creature just as it pounced on her like a lion.<br><br>The make-shift stake hit its mark, skewering the creature straight through its monstrous heart.<br><br>The creature shrieked something awful and collapsed to its knees, holding the stake. Wiping her brow, Haddie stepped away from the creature and approached her brother. But a sudden squelching sound froze her to the core. Slowly, she turned to watch the creature pull out the stake with the pulpy, dead heart still attached.<br><br>The creature tossed the heart to the side with a mangled smile. An instant later, it pounced over Haddie, taking her to the ground. Haddie pushed and jerked under its powerful grip as it salivated and peered hungrily at the thick arterial vein pumping in her neck.<br><br>Saliva dripped down Haddie's neck slow, warm and slimy like a slug. She screamed, and then had no breath to scream and began to see not stars but…geometry… symbols… symbols she had previously discovered in The Overlap as she often called it. She didn't know what else to call what she understood to be a Venn intersection of worlds where she could see and access knowledge and memories no one else could.<br><br>Haddie closed her eyes and saw the twisted triangle symbol she had just uncovered in an ancient temple. Then she saw the strange circle slashed in half with a line that she had discovered all over the walls and floor of an abandoned asylum as though someone or something was conducting dark experiments in The Overlap on the patients. It was all very bizarre and new to her.<br><br>Now, as the creature prepared to feast on her blood, Haddie wasn't seeing memories pass before her eyes but all these strange and arcane symbols that felt older than life itself—as though someone or something were trying to send her a message from The Overlap."
Beneath the Ruins 4,Tome07_Observer,"Chamber of Blood. Harbinger of Hell. Beneath the Ruins 4.<br><br>As the creature prepared to quench its thirst, Haddie felt the end coming. Desperate hands fumbled over dirt and twigs, searching for something, anything. Then, just as the creature prepared to puncture her neck, she grabbed a rock the size of a baseball and smashed it straight through its mouth, shattering its deadly fangs.<br><br>The creature jolted to its feet with mad agony. Pieces of bone and tooth dropped into a thick puddle of blood and saliva. Haddie turned to see Jordan moaning. He was alive, barely, nevertheless alive. Relieved, she scrambled to her feet, trying to think of a way to destroy this ancient evil once and for all. Then she saw it—<br><br>The revolver!<br><br>Hanging from the belt!<br><br>Without hesitation, she rushed up to the creature as two new white fangs pushed out the bloody remnants of the old. Before it realized what was happening, she snatched the revolver and shot the creature point-blank in the face.<br><br>The creature fell head over heels as Haddie unloaded the revolver into its face and body. But bullets were futile against this otherworldly apparition. Within moments the creature was clambering to its feet the whole while staring at Haddie with blood-red eyes. Nervously, she inched backward, not knowing where to go or what to do. There was nowhere to go. Nothing she could do. This was the end.<br><br>With incredible speed and strength, the creature pounced and took Haddie to the ground. Gleaming white fangs approached her neck with malice. She jerked and kicked and screamed under its weight. She felt its warm breath inches away from the nape of her neck. Then, in her mind's eye she saw them again.<br><br>The symbols.<br><br>All of them.<br><br>They swirled and flashed and then coalesced into one symbol—the symbol she had seen etched in the casket. With dawning realization, she understood. The symbol wasn't a warning but a seal—a seal to imprison this unfathomable, indescribable creature.<br><br>As the creature prepared to gorge on her life, she managed to grab something sharp off the ground—<br><br>Its broken fang!<br><br>And with the last of her strength, she managed to etch the crescent and the three dots deep into its cheek.<br><br>Suddenly, the creature's eyes widened into great big pools of disbelief. It looked at Haddie in abject terror as it stumbled backward, desperately trying to scratch the symbol off its ghastly face.<br><br>But it was too late.<br><br>Black mist like acid bubbled and burned through the creature's skin. The percolating mist filled its lungs, chest and neck. The belly and chest ballooned as pressure bludgeoned the creature from within. Then, with an agonized shriek, it exploded like a cherry bomb.<br><br>Covered in gore, Haddie dragged herself beside her rousing brother.<br><br>""What did I miss?"" he groaned and sat up, leaning against the tree. He narrowed his gaze and peered through the thin red mist of blood that hung heavy in the air. ""Where's the—""<br><br>His voice trailed away as he noticed the shards of bone and chunks of flesh covering his clothes. In silence, they picked off bits and pieces of the creature. Then Jordan broke the silence, saying, ""Well… this was pleasant… pleasant as a funeral.""<br><br>Haddie didn't respond to his stupidity. She was thinking about the symbols they had come across in their investigations. She wondered what they meant, where they came from, and if there was something connecting all these paranormal sites they were being sent to investigate. Moreover, she wondered if their benefactor was using them in some kind of chess game against forces unknown."
MEMORY 4097,Tome07_Plague,"May your voice reach the beyond; may your voice reach the beyond; may your voice… Adiris speaks this line until it becomes a single word, babbled in harmony with her fellow emissaries in faith. Ma-ya-voy-rethebe'on… Ma-ya-voy-rethebe'on… Thirteen women stand in a circle around a stone altar. Adiris' chant falters as time passes, her raw throat the only indication she contributes. Each enunciation, agony. She's nearly forgotten the naked man writhing face down on the altar, leather straps binding him.<br><br>The high priest Haban raises a hand. Adiris, along with each of the emissaries, stops, bows her head. She reminds herself: Cherish the pain, a sacrifice to the sea goat, the God of Water and Creation. The emissaries disperse, and Adiris wanders to the man on the altar. Tears stream from his bloodshot eyes. She wants to lend comfort, assure him the gods love him, perhaps even pull him from the altar, away from the coming pain. She smiles at him as she would a child. If only you understood the importance of your sacrifice, you would laugh with joy. Tenderly, lovingly, she kisses his forehead.<br><br>May your voice reach the beyond."
MEMORY 4106,Tome07_Plague,"Though Adiris' movements are met with pain, she lifts her head to the sky, thanking the gods for their guidance. Their whisper remains, further away, dissipating, yet still commanding, influencing. She opens her heart, allows the whisper to seize her body. She strides to the quarters of the Maiden's Guard and takes a uniform, confident no one will discover the violation, knowing the gods are on her side. A censer of sweet frankincense sits atop a table, compelling her to it. She allows her hands to move as they will, filling the censer with oil and glowing embers. She does not question the will of the gods, knowing all threads shall be woven and someday the tapestry complete. Trust in them, Adiris!<br><br>She steps into the moonlight. Nightfall. Smoke dances around her body. Bare feet carry her along a stone path to the mouth of the temple. As she peers inside, she sees through the shadows to the slight, shivering figure of the high priest Haban—the mentor, the father, the blasphemer.<br><br>May his voice reach the beyond."
MEMORY 4098,Tome07_Plague,"The Invokist comes forward: small, wrinkled man, buried under a scarlet—no, white but bloody—cloak. Adiris bows her head, joins the whispers around her. May you swim through sea and stars. The Invokist stands over the man bound to the altar. Nods. Pulls a sleeve back. Reveals a spear gripped in hand. Raises the weapon and… plunges! The tip pierces the bound man's lower back. He arches upwards and screams, shakes, convulses, lower body remaining immobile, bladder emptying onto the altar. The Invokist hefts his leg onto the stone slab, pushes the spear until—a gruesome snap. Shrieking… howling… pleading? Something beyond that—indescribable. A vertebrae bursts from the gaping wound. Blood gushes.<br><br>Bile rises in Adiris’ throat as she turns away to stop herself from retching. Her fellow emissaries look upwards. Praise! Glory to the gods! Nothing is heard over the screams of the man. His voice will surely reach the beyond. Adiris composes herself, recites sacred text in her mind: The plans of the gods shall not be questioned, for they know beauty the human eye cannot perceive. The plans of the gods shall not be questioned, for they know…<br><br>Trust in them, Adiris, trust in them! She relents to her faith, joining the others to celebrate, but notices—Haban. He covers his face too late and she sees it: a tear spilling from his eye. A face that seems… heartbroken."
MEMORY 4099,Tome07_Plague,"Adiris splashes water over the altar and scrubs. Red circle, swirling, bright… like the sun the day she was left at the temple door. Stifling heat, painful steps on burning sand. Mother and father… a missing piece in the memory, unfocused, replaced by… Haban. A crowd of imposing high priests, and only he peers warmly. She cries so he lifts her, removes his hood. In the courtyard he lets her touch the statues of the gods—Rishan, keeper of the stars; Ortares, sentry of the desert; Atil-Alara, mother of humanity—deities who would watch over and protect her. Haban becomes teacher. Father. He tells of their religion: formed by exiles who believed other faiths had become corrupted by politics. They brought new insights to the afterlife and unified all gods beneath the great creator, the sea goat.<br><br>She finds guidance in his teachings, meaning in servitude, comfort in knowing suffering is love. She may shudder at connecting compassion to bloody sacrifice, but she works continually to overcome her doubts. Yet, over the years, as her faith grows, Haban changes in a different way. She sees heaviness in his walk. Hears his voice trail off when he reads the sacred texts. While he once stood energized by generous sacrifices to the gods, today he shows anguish.<br><br>What darkness could snuff the desert sun?"
MEMORY 4100,Tome07_Plague,"Adiris sits in the courtyard, Haban seated across from her. Eyes are fixed on a game board between them. She rolls a wooden die, moves a black disc over the board's squares, lands on Haban's piece, places it to the side. No reaction from Haban. Adiris looks to him, sweet expression of concern. A joyous sacrifice this morning, would you say? The gods rejoice, praise be. Haban hardly lifts an eye. Mhmm… praise be. A cool breeze, birds chirp, unseen. Haban seems to scan the courtyard. Upon seeing no other occupants, looks Adiris in the eyes. He was a good man. A friend. And the world is darker without—<br><br>Adiris wonders if she’s being tested. She knows what to say, interrupts him with the line that’s been delivered to her thousands of times before: It was commanded by the gods; he swims in the wake of the sea goat now. Haban turns his attention to the game board, flicks away Adiris' disc and positions his at the end. It seems I have won… as was commanded by the gods. Adiris pushes her chair back, objecting. Haban sweeps the board off the table. I shall write the rules of Ur anew. I shall include decrees, punishment, theft, and sacrifice. And should anyone object, I shall preach those momentous words: It was commanded by the bloody sea goat and his damned gods. Adiris shakes her head, the shock of words she never thought she’d hear rattling painfully in her mind. This is… blasphemy! Deep bags under Haban's eyes seem to swell. Yes, the truth often is."
MEMORY 4101,Tome07_Plague,"The Day of Virtue arrives, a monthly ceremony to purify the congregation of dire sins. A bell tolls. Adiris and the rest of the temple's crowd drop to their knees. Forehead touches cold stone. She peeks up, sees the Maiden Guard arrive, stepping through the crowd, guided by faith to seek out sinners. She waits, counts the scratches in the floor until—a scream. A woman pleads and… coughing, choking. Adiris looks up, sees a commoner dragged from the temple by her throat. She hardly notices two olive-brown feet step in front of her. Rise. Rise! Adiris shrinks under the Maiden's gaze, notices the hint of ripened dates from her open mouth. Under the eyes of the sea goat, speak of the evil you have witnessed. Deliver us thieves, adulterers, and blasphemers, so we may purge them. Shoulders stiffen. Adiris sees the face of Haban, the face of the man who raised her. She hears his gentle voice… and the agitated voice of a blasphemer. Indecision knots in her chest, tightening, twisting.<br><br>I have witnessed… no evil. By the gods, my eyes are pure. The Maiden examines Adiris. Seconds trickle by, ever-slowing, stretching reality to its seams, until—the Maiden nods. May you swim through sea and stars. She turns away, and Adiris summons every bit of strength to keep herself from collapsing."
MEMORY 4102,Tome07_Plague,"Adiris sweeps dust from the altar floors. A set of hurried footsteps click along the stone, marching closer. She turns to see Haban, gentle face tensing. He hushes her. My daughter, curse the man I once was. I took you as a child and tainted you with notions of divine judgment and punishment. Now I see you struggle, as these thoughts nearly take hold. I beg you, cast my teachings aside and see the blood spilled in this temple. No cleansing can purify the horror perpetrated here.<br><br>The doctrine overflows in her mind: The will of the gods is law. No man shall question the divine. He who battles the tides will perish. But she surprises herself by remaining silent, and Haban seizes the moment. I am old and have wasted this life, but I cannot bear to destroy yours. Meet me here at nightfall in a fortnight's time, and we shall escape the clutches of deceit. If you have doubts, I ask you to consult with your gods. My daughter, may their silence be your answer."
MEMORY 4103,Tome07_Plague,"Though Adiris' heart beats, she feels emptiness where it should reside, a hollow space dripping acid into her churning stomach. Knees bruised, she prays to the gods, pleading, silently screaming for an answer. Nothing. The wind remains calm. She is alone, surrounded by stone, looked down upon by statues of gods unmoved. Dust floats through the air, settles on her skin, more real than anything she ever believed. A lifetime of faith, security, crumbles. She feels unsteady, the only certainty in her mind that she must leave this place. She rises to her feet, turns her back to the temple, only then—<br><br>A whisper!<br><br>The hushed chitter in her head is unclear, inarticulate words passed through a forked tongue. But she <i>feels</i> it, understands a remarkable truth: she will never be alone. Ever."
MEMORY 4104,Tome07_Plague,"Shame washes over Adiris as she retreats to her room. She dared doubt the gods. Within their chaotic whispers: pain, anger, bloodlust. ATONE! She removes her robe, reaches for the lash, a crude whip of thorns and bronze spikes. ATONE! She swings with great force. Spikes pierce her back, hooking into flesh as she pulls away. Through gritted teeth, she screams, keeping the sound in the base of her throat so no one can hear. ATONE! She swings, droplets of blood sprinkling to the floor. Spasms of pain, as skin tears off, hanging on pale threads. Braces herself and whips again, again, till the crimson pools. ATONE! How much blood is enough? Her body screams in agony. She thinks to drop the lash, run from these walls, but remembers the doctrine Haban taught her: Suffering is the heart of love. She tightens her grip and swings again."
MEMORY 4105,Tome07_Plague,"Sweat weeps from Adiris' pores onto her bedsheets. Thick scabs tear from her flesh as she shifts. With great effort, she lifts her head, looking to the sound behind her. Haban. He kneels over her, wet cloth in hand. She's too feeble to speak, but the whisper does it for her, hissing, thrashing, communicating a hurried feeling in her mind. BLASPHEMER! He washes the blood from her back, bringing his mouth to her ear. Is this the doing of the Maiden Guard? What has their blind faith wrought?<br><br>She slips between consciousness, as the blasphemer takes her hand. I have failed you, my daughter. But no more. Have strength, and we shall soon escape."
Memory 3559,Tome08_Clown,"Time to finish this. Kill the bastard. Right now. Jeffrey Hawk makes his move, rounds the corner of his trailer. He squints, sees footprints in the soft ground. Bingo. Crouches low, belly skimming over the dirt. A crowd roars from the circus tent three hundred yards away. He uses the sounds to conceal his movement. Then he sees it: the shadow of his chosen victim. Focus. Bring on the carnival of carnage. He shifts his weight to his back foot and springs.<br><br>I’ll shred y’up good, you sonnuva bitch! He grabs the raccoon, ripping the creature from his trashcan. They tumble. Garbage spills to the ground. Sharp pain and dull discomfort as he rolls through broken glass, cigarette butts, and half-eaten corndogs. This is the last time you invade my trash! The raccoon twists, snaps at air until finding a fat chunk of flesh. Ah, damnit! Jeffrey loses his grip, recovers just in time to grab a bushy tail. He’s on the defensive; swings the animal around, whirling it like a lasso. He loses his grip. The raccoon soars through the air, reaching incredible heights. The squealing, thrashing silhouette of the woodland creature flies over the backdrop of a full moon. Majestic. It arcs downwards and… lands safely in a tree. Blast it all to hell! With a furious hiss, the raccoon scurries into the foliage and disappears. Scram, ya hairball… touch my garbage again and I’ll make a balloon animal outta your intestines. He wipes a smear of blood onto his pants. A blaring of trumpets rings through the night, coming from the circus tent in the distance. The acrobats are taking the stage! He had nearly forgotten his plan. There’s hope for this night yet."
Memory 3560,Tome08_Clown,"Jeffrey hurries into the circus tent, anticipation buzzing through his veins. He stands at the back of the bleachers, avoiding the gawking, idiotic crowd. All eyes are glued to the trapeze artist swinging above. Ha, they have no idea! The best comedy is unexpected, and only Jeffrey knows the punchline: he greased the second trapeze an hour ago. Spotlights, a drum roll, the acrobat flips through the air, grabs the next trapeze and whoops—slips right off. Down, down… splat. The sudden and exhilarating crunch of breaking bones. But nothing compares to the splat. The splat makes it all worth it. Like a ripe tomato thrown against a wall. And then, silence. A hundred people in shock. Trauma forming in their brains. Future nightmares being scripted. The moment broken by a single woman’s scream, followed by a hundred more. Jeffrey can’t hold it any longer. He bellows laughter, nearly suffocates with glee. No one can hear over the turmoil. Half the crowd rushes to the exit, needing air, needing to be sick, needing a stiff drink. What a show! Jeffrey chuckles, wipes his tears, and then—oh my. His eyes glaze over. So many fingers pass by. Hundreds of them. He’s a kid in a candy shop, and the possibilities are measured by the handful."
Memory 3561,Tome08_Clown,"He’s paralyzed with indecision. As the crowd streams by, he appraises their hands. Long fingers, stout fingers, pristine, and ugly. Don’t be greedy now, you get one. Gotta keep things quiet, the fuzz will be snooping after the trapezist’s ‘accident.’ He spots a candidate worth his attention: three inches on the left hand of a young woman. Smoother knuckles than the norm. What does it taste like? Candy apple, maybe. Or… brass? Why brass? With considerable effort the memory arises: a first-grade teacher with a similar finger who used to wear cheap rings. He was a brat but she was too hard on him. A burst of endorphins tickles his spine. How would he immortalize this stand-in for his first-grade teacher? A sharpened pencil to her jugular? Stupid. Obvious. Pandering to irony. But also, satisfying in its cartoonish simplicity. Wait—what about the plump man with plump fingers? Thick sausages ready to burst with the slightest pinprick. A reminder of the mailman who yelled at him for flinging dog crap at a car. Bastard. I was just a kid having fun. Could fry up that finger and feed it to the local mutt. The fantasy is liberating. A righting of wrongs. And then… he sees it. The one. He shudders, recoils like he’s seen a ghost, but is suddenly drawn to it, unable to look away. It’s the finger he’s always searched for, always longed to make his own. Attached to a hand, to an arm, to a man with a very stupid moustache. He has found it: the Finger of Chaos."
Memory 3562,Tome08_Clown,"Jeffrey is fixated on the moustached man’s finger as he walks by, so close he can taste the alcohol-soaked sweat between the joints. He knew a finger just like it. In a different life. Before the circus.<br><br>He’s seven-years-old, in his bedroom, playing with a plastic army man. He throws it against the wall. Bites its head till his tooth hurts. But then, the unexpected: chaos awakens. His father shouts from the living room with a booming voice. Jeffrey retreats to his closet. He hears his father coming down the hall, each step louder. Hide! He buries himself under a pile of dirty clothes and shuts his eyes. The closet door swings open. The odor of cheap beer floods in as a large hand grabs him, pulls him. Why! Why, you little shit? Branson says you kicked his damn dog. That true? Jeffrey’s too afraid to say the words forming in his head: It's true. I walloped the smelly mutt good. Don’t know why. Just something like a reaction. Don’t get twisted about it, ain’t nothing different I coulda done. His father shoves his finger straight into Jeffrey’s face. Speak up, you damned idiot! You think I want to be stuck with you? The finger. Thick, oddly straight, a knuckle with ridges upon ridges of loose skin, a chipped nail that lends it personality. Your mom would have hated you. You listening? Jeffrey can’t look his father in the eyes. He retreats to his imagination. Hack off his finger, Jeffrey! Make dad cry, make the blood spurt. Point the finger right back in his face and laugh. Laugh, Jeffrey! His father looks ready to burst as his face reddens. This funny to you? You some kind of clown? Keep laughing and see what happens. And though Jeffrey fears his punishment, he can’t get the bloody thoughts out of his head—so he laughs and laughs.<br><br>Jeffrey examines Moustache’s finger as the crowd jostles around the circus tent. On his hand: a finger, thick, oddly straight, knuckles with ridges of loose skin, and yes, even a chipped nail. It may not be the original, but damn, it'll do nicely."
Memory 3563,Tome08_Clown,"Jeffrey barrels through the crowd, keeping an eye on the moustached man and his index finger. He pushes a lady aside, strong arms a man. Move along, ya jerks. Everyone’s too disturbed by the acrobat’s death to be upset by a clown’s social faux pas. It’ll be days before it crosses anyone’s mind: Did that clown really elbow an old woman in the face? Jeffrey spots Moustache walking through the fair grounds. Tents, Ferris wheels, and food booths have gone dark, closed for the night. The scent of deep fryers and popcorn is still thick in the air.<br><br>Moustache breaks from the crowd. Perfect. Time to get to work. Jeffrey disappears into cover. Despite his size, despite his bright, gaudy clothing, he naturally slinks through the shadows. His anger over the raccoon infiltrating his garbage has fizzled away. There is only one creature of the night that lives here. His name is Jeffrey Hawk."
Memory 3564,Tome08_Clown,"The hunt begins. This is Jeffrey’s moment. The anger and revulsion fades, if only for a few minutes, allowing him to exist in comfort. He doesn’t stumble or slow as he stalks through the deep darkness. Takes sure, steady steps. He wants to remember this moment. It’s simple. One man with a wonderful finger. One clown that’s going to kill him. If only that was the whole of history, the entirety of existence. Wipe out the jealousy, betrayal, and greed, the tax collectors and nosy neighbors, the dogs that bark all night, the women who lead men on, the endless stream of cars, and the suitcases full of lies. Erase the whole overwhelming thing, the pain that ties it together—he doesn’t want to be a part of it, he was never good at it anyway. Leave one simple moment: A clown, a man, and a murder.<br><br>He’s jolted from his tranquility as a branch snaps underneath his foot. Thirty paces ahead, Moustache straightens up like a meerkat, swings his head around. He knows something’s out there. Something unseen. Hello…? Please… is someone there… I don’t know what’s happening. Jeffrey chuckles. Neither do I."
Memory 3565,Tome08_Clown,"Jeffrey keeps to the shadows, makes his way closer to Moustache. He moves swiftly, silently… almost silently. He hacks into his sleeve and spits a mass of phlegm into the dirt. Wheezes. Could use a smoke and a shot’a something. Bah, keep moving. Skulks past the cotton candy stand and around the fortune teller’s tent. No use drawing it out any further. It’s time. Bring on the clown!<br><br>Jeffrey paces slowly from the shadows. Large, imposing, smeared in grease paint, wearing a ridiculous coat of stripes, polka dots, and patches. And the blade, beauty in simplicity. That’s all it takes. Moustache squeals like a pig and scurries. All according to plan. Corral him past the pony stables, around the freak show, and—cut him off. Give him nowhere to run but the Haunted Hostel and really have some fun with the chump. Moustache sprints towards the rundown shack, covered in spatters of red paint and cheap imitation spider webs. But then—he turns. Beelines away from the Haunted Hostel and towards… no, not that—the Fun House of Friendship. All the makeup in the world can't cover the disgust. A deep, resigned sigh. Jeffrey stands in front of a bright pink and blue building painted in smiling, cartoonish faces of giraffes, elephants, and bears. A sign on the front says ‘50 Cents Admission—You’re in for a Ton of Safe, Friendly Fun’. Damnit all."
Memory 3566,Tome08_Clown,"Darkness. Jeffrey hears Moustache bumping around up ahead but can’t see a thing. He fumbles with wires, jams them at a wall, searching for an outlet. Bingo. Colorful lights flood over him. Playful music fills the area. An animatronic dog stares at Jeffrey with dead plastic eyes. Let's be friends. Jeffrey delivers a solid kick to the dog’s chest. Let’s be fr-fr-fr-frieeeeee—. Moving on. As soon as Jeffrey reaches the hall, he’s overtaken by a teddy bear parade. Cartoonish animatronics emerge from the walls, singing, smashing cymbals, playing flutes. Or at least pretending to. Crackling music plays from speakers above, singing a stupid song about hugs bringing the world together. Jeffrey elbows his way past Billy Bear and Dingles. Buries a blade into Laffy’s neck. Gets tangled up by Terry Tickle’s outstretched arms. Smashes off Poppo’s lower jaw. Before he knows it, he’s waist deep in the ball pit canal. Navigating the balloon forest. And that’s where he finds Moustache—hiding at the feet of an animatronic tiger wearing a British guard’s uniform. Bah… the longer you cower behind Sir Cuddlepuss, the more I'm gonna make this hurt.<br><br>Moustache makes a run for it. Jeffrey pulls a bottle of Afterpiece Tonic from his inner pocket. Gives it a swirl and hucks. Glass shatters. A thick cloud of fumes envelope Moustache. The man stumbles and coughs, looks around in confusion, crisscrosses his feet as if each one wants to go a separate way. Jeffrey socks the idiot in the side of the head, knocking him unconscious. Time to go home."
Memory 3567,Tome08_Clown,"The man with the moustache is huddled in the corner of Jeffrey’s trailer. Babbling, crying, pleading his case. Jeffrey isn’t listening. All he sees is the finger… and the puddle at Moustache’s feet. Jeffrey knows what it means. The man's realized he has one chance at survival, and his fight or flight just kicked in. But Jeffrey doesn’t care, he knows he’s already won. The Finger of Chaos is as good as his. The memories of his father are already shifting. A large, horrible man towering above, bellowing—no, that isn’t it. Think, Jeffrey. A weak, slouching alcoholic, stammering and slurring, too pathetic to control him. The outburts? Nothing but the fury of a coward, the parody of a powerful man—a joke!<br><br>Moustache jumps up, reaches for the bottles of chemicals on the counter. Predictable. Jeffrey bellows laughter as he grabs the man’s neck and slams him to the floor. Puts his full weight onto Moustache, grips his throat and squeezes. You want to play with chemicals, do ya? I don’t even know what'd happen if those mixed. Hallucinations… euphoria… uncontrolled flatulence… death? Jeffrey thinks this over as he repeatedly smacks Moustache’s head into the floor. They all sound like hilarious endings. And why not add some uncertainty to the mix? He doesn’t need to fear chaos anymore. He can handle it. And hell, he deserves a little fun.<br><br>You want to play one last game? Okay, Moustache… let’s play."
Memory 881,Tome08_Jake,"Jake bites his lower lip with the thought of chowing down on a rack of ribs—smoking, charred, succulent ribs. He shakes his head and returns his focus to the moment… to the wild hog he’s been tracking through the woods all morning and afternoon. But he can’t get the thoughts out of his mind. He’s never had such a hard time keeping his focus. When he’s not thinking about food he’s thinking about the past, about home, about the argument. Seems like it happened so long ago. The argument started on Friday and by Monday morning, he was out on his own, exiled from the only life he knew for disobedience. But it wasn’t disobedience. Not to Jake. To Jake it was a need. No. It was more than a need. It was a longing… a profound longing to know where he came from and why his father never talked about him.<br><br>But you didn’t have to push him so hard, did you?<br><br>I did. I had to. I had to because I had the right to know who he was. Don’t you see? I have an emptiness inside me that no money or thing can fill. Yet… he never told me anything about him… he just distracted himself with the business and all the trappings of a superficial life and—<br><br>Raising you, Jake! Raising his boys!<br><br>Jake stares past trampled grass and he hears his mother’s voice resounding through his head. Jake… please… you are expecting a straight thing, and no straight thing has ever been made. Your father isn’t perfect, and everything he’s done is to give you a better life than he had. He has his reasons.<br><br>And I have mine!<br><br>Jake closes his eyes. He remembers leaving home without saying goodbye. He remembers backpacking across Korea, meeting people who had known his grandfather and could tell him stories about how he had lived. And none of the stories he had been told justified burying the past the way his father had done. He had expected his grandfather to be an abusive, deadbeat and yet… he had discovered a hero… a legend even. He had saved and reunited so many families and so many were grateful and indebted and still… he never mentioned him.<br><br>Maybe he didn’t want a legend, Jake. Maybe he wanted something else. But why does it matter? Why does it matter right now?<br><br>A voice of caution suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. His grandfather’s voice or what he thinks his grandfather would have sounded like. Jake… stop thinking about everything else except what you need to think about. You need to eat before you begin to see things that aren’t there. You’ve been at it all morning and afternoon with that make-shift spear, and if you don’t get the hog you’ll end up like me.<br><br>Jake nods with a slight respectful bow as he examines the freshly trampled grass."
Memory 890,Tome08_Jake,"Wolves growl and lunge and rip pieces of flesh off the dangling carcass. Jake holds the cord tightly with one hand as he uses the other hand to attack the wolves with a branch. He’s exhausted and doesn’t know what to do. He feels like a tick beaten and battered by the rain… broken… beaten… defeated… Not by the hunt, or the wolves but the thoughts and emotions swarming in his head like a hive of anxious bees.<br><br>The wolves circle the tree with cackles and growls that seem like laughter in the night. How the hell did I end up here? Up a tree fighting wolves in the middle of nowhere! And how the hell am I gonna get down? He hears his brother’s voice break through the din below.<br><br>The stupid shit we do when we’re lost and alone, right bro?<br><br>Jake swallows a growing lump in his throat and admits the truth for the first time in years. You’ve always seen right through me, little bro. God, I miss you. But you’re right… I am lost and I am alone… and I have no idea who I am or what I want to do with my life… and that fortune-teller was right… I didn’t know what to choose… so I chose nothing.<br><br>His mother’s voice returns. No, Jake. He was wrong. You did choose something.<br><br>Jake draws a deep shuddering breath and closes his eyes, remembering his first birthday as his mother had described it so many times.<br><br>He’s dressed in his first red and blue Hanbok, sitting on a white blanket with all kinds of objects spread before him. Pens. Rice. Paint. Ink. Brushes. Money. His aunts, uncles and cousins encourage him to choose something with exaggerated baby-talk.<br><br>The fortune-teller asks everyone to be quiet and says the object Jake picks first will be the driving motivation of his life. The birthday boy drags himself toward the objects… drags himself past the pen… past the rice and the cake… past the ink and the brushes… nothing seems to interest him. But then—<br><br>He spots something. His eyes go wide with excitement, and he charges toward—<br><br>The money!<br><br>Yells! Screams! More baby-talk to encourage him to take the money! But—<br><br>Jake doesn’t take the money. He doesn’t even look at it. He surprises everyone by charging past the money with perfect focus and he only stops when he reaches a man kneeling in prayer. One-year-old Jake looks up at his father, smiles, and grabs his finger. His father smiles back at him, and his mother takes a picture—<br><br>The picture.<br><br>Jake opens his eyes and now he hears his mother’s voice above the snapping and snarling wolves. The fortune-teller didn’t really know what to tell us. He said we didn’t arrange the objects properly. He said you chose nothing. But I think we both know he was wrong.<br><br>I don’t understand…<br><br>It’s been years, Jake. Finish the letter. Teach him about his father. And come back home.<br><br>I wouldn’t know what to write… what to say…<br><br>You’ll figure it out. Just remember that he respects what you did because in the end he knows…<br><br>You chose family.<br><br>You always did, and you always will. That’s why I know you’ll do what needs to be done. Come back… help him complete his story.<br><br>The imaginary words strike Jake’s heart like lightning. His eyes widen with sudden understanding, and for the first time in his life he wonders… he wonders what it would have been like to grow up without a father. To miss all the things his father gave him. To miss all the things he took for granted…<br><br>Hiking. Fishing. Hunting. Camping. Fun and fierce games of Baduk in moonlit tents. It wasn’t all superficial bullshit. There was good, too. A lot of good.<br><br>He was so contradictory.<br><br>Aren’t we all.<br><br>I suppose we are.<br><br>Jake loosens his grip on the cord and stares at the frenzied wolves below, and for the first time in his life, he knows exactly what he needs to do."
Memory 882,Tome08_Jake,"Jake charges after the boar as it zigzags through the long grass and suddenly disappears near the creek. Panting, he slows to a jog, searching left and right. He’s hiding. Hiding like the letter his father hid in the attic. Don’t lose your focus, Jake… not now… not again…<br><br>I don’t understand why he would hide such a beautiful letter in a shoebox?<br><br>Ah, yes…the letter. It’s the letter that set you off on your journey. It’s the letter that inspired you to learn your father’s language properly. You wanted to translate it for yourself, and you did. But now, Jake, you need to stop thinking about the letter, about your father, about the past… you need to focus on the hunt or none of it will matter anymore. Find food or become food.<br><br>Jake winces. His grandfather would never say such a thing. That’s something his father would say. The voices in his head are mixing like a horrible stew of fermenting leftovers. He doesn’t remember when he started hearing the voices but at some point out on his own in the mountains, he realized he was talking to himself and that talking to himself helped him cope with the loneliness.<br><br>Everyone hears voices inside their head, Jake, although most are too distracted to listen or even acknowledge them, or, if they do acknowledge them, they keep them private for fear of ridicule.<br><br>Most of Jake’s voices are family members and old friends that make friendly talk here and there, but as of late the voices poke and question everything he does.<br><br>And now for the last two days he was hearing a new voice. A mocking voice that highlighted and criticized every mistake he made like his dreaded high school English teacher that made him read garbage he didn’t connect with or gave him nicknames like ‘muddle brain’ for mixings up words, reading backwards and seeing things in the stories she claimed weren’t there. They were. She just lacked imagination and perspective.<br><br>It was her voice—teeth grinding on wool—that squelched through his mind to undermine his dignity and confidence as a thinking human being.<br><br>Jake was convinced his teacher had existed solely to prevent those with other ideas and perspectives from ever pursing a literary career. His father didn’t care about his issue with his English teacher or with teachers in general.<br><br>It didn’t matter.<br><br>Stories didn’t matter.<br><br>Just tell the teacher what she wants to hear. Think of her as your boss and think of grades as money. Parrot her ideas and opinions and you’ll be rewarded with lots of money… maybe even a bonus or a promotion.<br><br>Easy enough advice to follow.<br><br>And yet his father’s advice did nothing to improve his sense of otherness in relation to the stories and curriculum he was subjected to on an almost daily basis. He still felt like an outsider for lacking interest in the literature and history he was expected to read and memorize as truths undeniable. Seemed like there was a big chunk of perspective missing from the overall narrative being poured into him like concrete that made him feel like he didn’t belong.<br><br>But what does it matter now?<br><br>It doesn’t.<br><br>Leave the past in the past and focus on what needs to get done.<br><br>I’m trying.<br><br>Listen here, big brother… the sun’s coming down, you’re having conversations with yourself, and your cells are about to cannibalize one another. Find your focus."
Memory 883,Tome08_Jake,"Jake sits on a stone and watches a hawk circle against the golden dusk. He sighs and feels his stomach twist. He needs something… anything… and he regrets not taking the free granola bars from the clerk at the hunting store. He still doesn’t understand what he was trying to prove and to whom he was trying to prove it to. I guess I want to see if I could be like him.<br><br>You’ve brought trail mix and other snacks before. What’s so special this time?<br><br>Jake draws a deep, anxious breath. I don’t know…<br><br>The hawk sails through the darkening sky, then swoops and quickly disappears near the stream. Jake stares after it for a long moment, then decides. He grabs his spear, staggers to his feet and stealthily makes his way toward the shimmering water.<br><br>By a fallen tree he sees the hawk picking at feathers and bones. He inches closer, lifts his spear and launches it. The spear hits the ground, and the hawk rockets to the sky, leaving scraps behind. Scraps… Scraps will do. For now.<br><br>Jake kneels by a sticky clump of flesh and feathers. He smells the pungent odor of heart-pounding red. He touches the sticky innards and the plucked skin and the bones… bones as white as the hog’s grin.<br><br>Jake sighs his frustration and shakes his head. He doesn’t know if hogs display any kind of emotion. But if they can… this hog is definitely smiling. No… Not smiling… Laughing.<br><br>What kind of bird is this, anyway?<br><br>Doesn’t matter. Jake pulls out matches and cooks the guts, preparing a kind of bird-pudding.<br><br>You brought matches but no granola bars?<br><br>I don’t know what I was thinking.<br><br>You’re not him, Jake.<br><br>I know.<br><br>He died out there.<br><br>He disappeared.<br><br>Same thing.<br><br>Not to me."
Memory 884,Tome08_Jake,"Jake tries to spit the rancid taste of regurgitated bird out of his mouth as he tracks the boar. His stomach rejected most of what he tried to stuff into it, but he’s grateful he got some nourishment for his starving cells. He can’t even begin to imagine what it would be like to guide and care for others in the middle of nowhere. How’d he do it? How’d he feed them? How’d he lead them out of the woods with soldiers tracking them?<br><br>Jake stops suddenly to examine a few broken twigs. He brings his focus back to the hunt, trying to determine which direction the hog took. Then he hears it.<br><br>Snorting.<br><br>Almost inaudible, but he hears it. He turns toward a patch of shuffling high grass and narrows his gaze. The snorting grows louder and louder. He’s laughing at me! Sunnava bitch, is laughing at me!<br><br>You aren’t worthy, kid!<br><br>The hell I’m not!<br><br>Jake launches his spear into the moving grass. A high pitch squeal follows, and the hog jolts away!<br><br>Jake surges after him, tracking a trail of red to the mouth of a small cave. He laughs to himself and knows he will feast tonight. He’s done!<br><br>So sure?<br><br>I searched that cave before… there’s no other way out. It’s just a matter of time and patience.<br><br>And focus… Jake… focus…"
Memory 885,Tome08_Jake,"Jake figures an hour or so has passed and he’s noticed no movement or attempt to escape. This is a worthy adversary. He thinks he can outwait me.<br><br>It’s a good plan… He might actually escape. I’m betting on the hog.<br><br>You’ll lose, bro.<br><br>Jake considers his options, then grabs a small shovel out of his rucksack and begins to dig a pit. He feels cobalt eyes watching him and he grins to himself. It will take a bit of time… but this deadfall will put the odds in my favor.<br><br>The people his grandfather helped said he dug a tunnel under a small clearing to avoid detection… He dug a tunnel… Digging a small pit is nothing in comparison.<br><br>What I don’t understand is… you brought a shovel… and matches but no granola bars… What the hell were you thinking?<br><br>I guess I wasn’t.<br><br>You’re a walking contradiction, Jake.<br><br>I guess.<br><br>The stupid shit we do when we’re lost and alone.<br><br>I’m not lost or alone… I’m exactly where I want to be.<br><br>Yeah, yeah. The whole turn your back on civilized living because humanity and not you have lost your way. Make yourself believe whatever you want… but in the end… he’s your father.<br><br>He didn’t even try to reach out to me!<br><br>You didn’t try to reach out to him.<br><br>He kicked me out!<br><br>You poked and twisted an old wound. You hit a nerve and he reacted.<br><br>His father was a hero!<br><br>Maybe he didn’t want a hero, Jake. Maybe he just wanted a father… A living, breathing father to do shit with… kinda like what you got."
Memory 886,Tome08_Jake,"Jake stands next to his father and brother by the sizzling barbeque and the turquoise, inground pool. He takes in the scent of thick, fatty, white bacon melting into mounds of burning black charcoal. He reaches around his father and pulls off a strip and devours it. His father smiles and says it’s like he’s never seen food before.<br><br>Jake’s eyes widen as thick, droplets of grease drip off his chin. He suddenly pushes past his father and brother, attacking the grill, stuffing his face with greasy, life-giving fat and protein. His father tries to hold him back but Jake won’t be denied when suddenly the meat morphs into a living, wild hog. The hog turns to Jake and winks.<br><br>Jake stumbles back and falls into the pool.<br><br>The pool swirls and turns into a deadfall as several spikes rip through his chest. Jake yells in agony, waking up with a start, finding himself in a small pit beside thick, sharpened branches pointed outward.<br><br>Jake wipes the sweat off his brow and slowly clambers to his feet. He climbs out of the deadfall and stares into the darkness of the cave for a long moment. Then he hears his mother’s soothing voice.<br><br>Jake… please… finish the letter and send it to him.<br><br>Why? What’s the use? It’s just gonna end up in a shoebox in the attic like his father’s letter.<br><br>You’re wrong. It will be like the picture in his wallet.<br><br>That’s just a stupid picture!<br><br>Not to him."
Memory 887,Tome08_Jake,"I’m tired of waiting!<br><br>Jake grabs a few branches, sets them ablaze and tosses them into the dark, gaping mouth of the cave. He watches the darkness fill with lashing, flames and swirling, smoke, and he waits for the inevitable. As he stares at the thickening smoke, he’s reminded of a story and his thoughts drift away to his grandfather.<br><br>He reunited so many broken families. He helped so many people survive exposure, exhaustion and starvation. He saved them all and yet… he couldn’t save himself.<br><br>They said there was a kind of smoke, too… a thick black smoke that suddenly surrounded them. One minute he was there. The next… he was gone. The survivors Jake had spoken to in Seoul said he was probably captured and executed but that they didn’t know for sure.<br><br>A piercing squeal followed by a meaty thunk suddenly brings Jake back to the moment. He didn’t even see the hog make a dash for it. He leans over the pit and stares at the skewered hog shaking and convulsing as life pours out of its wounds.<br><br>Jake sighs and feels mingled relief and regret. Sorry, brother… it was either you or me."
Memory 888,Tome08_Jake,"Jake swallows a piece of charred meat and stares beyond the flickering fire at the gutted hog. All he need to do now is salt the meat. Took the whole day to get him but it was worth it. There’s enough meat on him to last him months. The bloody and carved hog suddenly turns to Jake. But you didn’t really get me, did you? Jake blinks. And blinks, again. Truth is I let you catch me cause I figured you chased me long enough. Jake shakes his head in disbelief, and he knows his mind is still playing tricks on him despite having eaten. The hog sighs sadly. You and I, Jake, we’re caught in the same vicious cycle so don’t feel so bad, all right? Today it’s me. Tomorrow it’s you.<br><br>Jake pinches himself but the hog continues. Chase something long enough and it will surrender itself to you. It will stop running and let you catch it so long as you stay the course. Just like that story you chased in the old country. Jake narrows his gaze on the grinning hog. Now you’re here on Blood Mountain trying to be your grandfather while trying to forget your father without realizing you’re both and neither of them at the same time.<br><br>Jake tries to shake the hallucination out of his head. Don’t worry, Jake, I’m not really talking… you’re tired and dehydrated… and completely lost in the woods. I’m just trying to give you some perspective or rather… you’re trying to give yourself some perspective.<br><br>Jake sighs deeply. I have no idea who I am or what I want to do and I’m talking to a dead hog in the middle of nowhere. The hog nods. Yes, you are. It’s interesting because your grandfather was poor and didn’t have many options and you’re not so poor and have too many options… I’m not sure which is worse… the tyranny of too little or the tyranny of too much… either way… a distracted life is a wasted life…<br><br>It’s good that you came out here to figure things out. And you know what else is good? If you let go… if you just let go…<br><br>I have let go and I’m still as lost as I ever was.<br><br>The hog snorts. You haven’t let go, Jake. You’re still playing the old scripts over and over again like a broken record. But let’s see… you like chasing stories… especially the hidden ones… you talk to yourself constantly… and you like being alone… maybe you’re a writer, Jake. Or maybe you’re a historian.<br><br>Jake laughs out loud. Are you kidding me! I hate history, and I failed every English class in high school cause I thought the rules were stupid and the teachers were boring.<br><br>You and every other writer that actually made a dent. English class doesn’t make a writer, Jake… Fighting class and dancing class do.<br><br>I don’t even know what that means!<br><br>It means you need guts and style, not grades and diplomas. It means you need courage and not the validation of some coward that doesn’t know what it’s like to lead someone on a dancefloor or step into a ring. It means your country needs a lot more stories like yours. Because let’s face it, Jake, if your story isn’t in the main narrative… if you’re just a footnote in a history book… you may as well not exist.<br><br>You’re not your grandfather, Jake. You’re not your father either. And every generation has its challenge. Oppression. War. Separation. Maybe the challenge of your generation is… representation. You gotta get your stories out there whether you’re a writer, historian, filmmaker or producer. Seems to me a lot of kids like you in the new country need to hear your story or stories like yours to know they aren’t alone. To know they belong and that they aren’t outsiders in their own home.<br><br>A chorus of howls brings Jake back to the moment. Wolves! And they’re coming for what’s mine! They howl again, and above the racquet he hears his father’s voice. In every transaction, Jake, there are wolves.<br><br>Not in this one.<br><br>Especially this one.<br><br>Jake ignores the voice in his head and tries to focus as he considers his next move carefully."
Memory 889,Tome08_Jake,"Jake sits high in a tree with the hog dangling from a cord. He grips the cord tightly and hopes the branch he’s uses as support doesn’t give way. Another howl rents the night and the chirping insects go silent. The wolves are coming, and they want what’s rightfully his. He’s glad he ate, and he feels new life coursing through his veins. He feels his focus sharpening, and yet he still hears his mother.<br><br>You should have finished the letter when you had a chance.<br><br>I’ll finish it another time.<br><br>If you get ‘another time’ Jake.<br><br>I will.<br><br>And what If you die here? What if you go missing? Your father will sell everything just to find you.<br><br>Yeah, right. All he cares about is his packaging empire.<br><br>You really don’t know your father if that’s what you think… or why he carries that picture with him everywhere he goes.<br><br>Jake scoffs. The picture means nothing! Even the fortune-teller didn’t know what it meant.<br><br>But it means something to him, Jake. It means the world to him. You point your finger at your father and accuse him of not understanding you… but did you ever try to understand him?<br><br>Several wolves approach the tree and peer up at Jake with eyes that reflect the shining full moon. Jake tries to silence the voice and reign his focus on the threat at hand. But the voice—the voice of family—refuses to be silenced.<br><br>Let me tell you something about your father, Jake… If he could give all his money away for just one chance to meet his father, he would. And… if you disappear because you were too pig-headed to let go… he’d drop everything just to find you. We all would.<br><br>Let go, Jake, and the wolves will disappear."
Arcus 13,Tome08_Observer,"The series featuring Haddie and Jordan on Terra 717 or Haley and Jaden on Terra 1315, or even Hannah and Justin on Terra 238 are all titled ‘HarbingerFM’ instead of ‘The Harbinger of Hell,’ and they seem to have more insight on what The Entity might be and how it corrupts and influences other worlds. Other Terra Worlds have quite unique and sometimes contradictory versions of the Harbinger series which make them difficult to track and interpret. But despite the discrepancies, each version seems to feature siblings trying to expose a nefarious cult devoted to The Entity.<br><br>I am currently searching the rift for the real memories that inspired all these adventures to see how close they are to the actual inspiration. I’m even wondering if Haddie and Jordan are here, trapped in The Entity, and, if they are, I’m hoping their memories will somehow help me find a way out of here. So far, I have found nothing close to a real memory, but I did find another story from Terra 717 in which Haddie discusses a phenomenon she calls ‘The Overlap’ and which other stories call The Borro, The Coil, The Bleed, etc.<br><br>I’m currently keeping extensive notes on the Harbinger stories and their descriptions of The Overlap to see if any of them can give me insight into what this phenomenon actually is. What I’ve discovered so far is that almost all of these stories describe places where a dark dimension intersects with the world and that these intersections seem to attract tragedy and misfortune. Some of these stories go so far as to claim ‘broken’ or ‘traumatized’ people can derive strange abilities from the vibrations emanating from these dark and ‘cursed’ places. These people can ultimately use The Bleed—my preferred name for the phenomenon—to access knowledge beyond the veil as it were.<br><br>The Harbinger series from Terra 719 is also worth noting because the details included by the author seem closest to what we studied back home concerning Ancients and living dimensions, not to mention what I’ve been able to discover by examining the memories of souls marooned here. Piece by piece, or rather, story by story, I’m getting closer to salvation… or insanity… whichever comes first."

Chamber of Blood. HarbingerFM. Worlds Away. 1.,Tome08_Observer,"Haddie entered the small deli in Manhattan, New York, approached a small booth, and plopped an envelope in front of her stepbrother Jordan. He stopped chewing his early morning, scrambled eggs and asked, “What’s this supposed to be?”<br><br>“I know who our mysterious benefactor is!” Haddie opened the envelope and pulled out a picture of a middle-aged man with salt and pepper hair in a dark suit.<br><br>Jordan shrugged. “Who am I looking at?”<br><br>“Surin Rivera. He was a sound engineer for a highly classified military project in the Office of Strategic Operations. He experienced a nervous breakdown and was institutionalized for years until he was released under the care of billionaire, philanthropist Kobe Dax. Others in the same program experienced similar breakdowns. One lives close by. The question is… why is Surin helping us?”<br><br>Jordan raised his finger and pointed to a man standing behind Haddie. “Why don’t you ask him yourself?” Haddie turned to face the man in the picture standing beside her.<br><br>Surin took a seat beside Jordan and said, “You need to leave my case alone. I assure you both… You’re not ready for what you’re prying into.”<br><br>“And what is that?” Haddie questioned.<br><br>Jordan took a small, nervous bite of his eggs and chewed slowly. “Let’s not provoke the man, sis. If we’re not ready… we’re not ready… I’m good with that.”<br><br>“How do you know our uncle?” Haddie asked when he didn’t answer her question. “Why are you helping us? What are these places you’re sending us to?”<br><br>Surin peered at Haddie for a long moment. Then he said, “Let’s just say I have a fond interest in your work and your special abilities.”<br><br>Jordan swallowed and shrugged. “Okay… sure… that’s good enough for me.”<br><br>“Not me.” Haddie’s face hardened as she waited for an answer. “I want to know why your helping us.”<br><br>Surin scanned the deli nervously, then turned back to Haddie and Jordan. “Take my advice and don’t go down this rabbit hole. Not yet. You’re not ready, and you’re exposing yourself to dangerous people.”<br><br>“What kind of people?” Haddie narrowed her gaze on him. “Police? Military? What are we talking about here?”<br><br>Surin shook his head gravely. “We’re talking about people who don’t answer to the police or military. People who create governments and corporations to use to their end and then throw them away like garbage when they’re done.”<br><br>“What do they want?” Haddie asked, unsatisfied with his answer.<br><br>Surin stood. “Leave my case alone. Focus on the show and the leads I send your way. All will be revealed in due time.”<br><br>Haddie held up the envelope with his picture. “I’m getting ahead of myself… is that it?”<br><br>“Leave my case alone,” Surin repeated and walked away.<br><br>Haddie and Jordan watched Surin exit the deli in silence. Then Jordan turned to see Haddie’s determined expression, and he knew they weren’t leaving anything alone."
Chamber of Blood. HarbingerFM. Worlds Away. 2.,Tome08_Observer,"“Come on, bro! Let’s get ahead of ourselves!” Haddie led Jordan to the entrance of a dilapidated house in the suburbs. “Colonel Jim Dunn worked with Surin Rivera in the OSO.” Before Haddie could say another word the door creaked open, revealing a plump, middle-age woman with short blond hair.<br><br>“Can I help you?”<br><br>Haddie smiled. “Yes. I was actually hoping to speak to Col Lt Dunn for our podcast.”<br><br>The woman took a step back. “Is this some kind of a prank?”<br><br>Haddie shook her head. “No, ma’am.”<br><br>“Jim disappeared seven years ago. No one has any answers for me, and all I’m left with are rumors.”<br><br>Jordan inched closer to the woman. “Maybe our podcast could help? Maybe someone out there can help you if you share his story.”<br><br>“Share his story?” The woman hesitated for a moment. Then she nodded and said, “Yeah… all right… I just want my Jim back.”<br><br>Haddie and Jordan entered the home and followed her to the kitchen where they sat around a small, round table.<br><br>“I can only tell you what Jim told me,” the woman said, taking a deep breath and releasing it slowly to calm her nerves. “He worked for the Office of Strategic Operations which was… I guess you could say… the stuff of conspiracy theories.”<br><br>She paused, then continued. “Did you know Jim said the word ‘conspiracy theory’ used to never exist until the military created the term? Once you could actually question the government’s narrative but now… you’re not questioning anything because you don’t want to be called a ‘conspiracy theorist.’”<br><br>The woman laughed, then added, “Brilliant, really, and that’s pretty much why no one questions the government anymore… even if you’ve got a dozen whistleblowers with leaked documents all saying the same thing… you don’t really doubt or question anything cause you don’t want to be stigmatized.”<br><br>The woman shook her head in disbelief and continued with a little laugh. “Jim used to say the origin of ‘conspiracy theory’ is a conspiracy theory… anyway… he told me… there were places in the world that weren’t like other places… places which defied the laws of physics… which defied human comprehension… places connected to worlds away… to other dimensions… the government called it The Overlap. Crazy stuff, right? ”<br><br>Jordan nodded.<br><br>Haddie didn’t respond. She had heard the term before when they were investigating a mysterious cult that believed in a kind of ancient deity that would one day help humanity evolve to another plane of existence. It’s a strange coincidence that this cult and the government would have the same name for the phenomenon.<br><br>“Like a wormhole?” Jordan questioned.<br><br>The woman shook her head. “That’s not how Jim described it. He didn’t talk much about The Overlap but he said what they had seen made him think another world was… how did he put it… consuming ours… like these Overlaps were growing bigger and bigger as we went down a kind of celestial digestive track… and… he said… he said they were pulling stuff out… things from other worlds….”<br><br>The woman fell silent and thoughtful for a long moment. “I could see changes in him. He was getting angrier and mean and he was never mean. He stopped sharing things with me. And I started hearing rumors.”<br><br>“What kind of rumors?” Haddie asked, leaning forward.<br><br>The woman went silent and thoughtful. Then she said, “Rumors that the government was doing things to them so they could stay in The Overlap for longer periods of time. I even heard that they pulled someone out from another world. Imagine that… a person from another world or dimension.”<br><br>Tears filled her eyes. “They say he left me… but I know my Jim… something happened to him and the authorities dismiss me as conspiracy theorist for saying otherwise. But I’ll tell you this—”<br><br>A sudden report and the woman’s mouth filled with thick, warm blood as she tried to speak. Shattered teeth and saliva gushed out instead of words. Then her eye went wide and she slumped forward.<br><br>Jordan cursed and instantly tackled Haddie to the ground as bullets began to rip through the house from every direction.<br><br>Haddie stared up at her brother as bullets flew over their heads like angry wasps. “I think… we got ahead of ourselves.”<br><br>“You think!”"
Chamber of Blood. HarbingerFM. Worlds Away. 3.,Tome08_Observer,"Bullets discharged from a flashing muzzle in the living room as Haddie followed her brother into the basement of the house. They stumbled down the stairs into the darkness and through a beam of sunlight pouring through a rectangular window. Before they could hide, the assassin was already descending the stairs with his rifle trained on them. Haddie and Jordan held hands and closed their eyes waiting for a quick death. A loud report sounded and when they opened their eyes they were both still standing.<br><br>The assassin stared at them with big white eyes of disbelief, then he collapsed to reveal Surin holding a smoking revolver. “Come on,” he said. “We need to leave before others come.”<br><br>The siblings didn’t hesitate, following Surin up the stairs and out the door past several dead bodies. Haddie counted seven dead assassins by the time she followed her brother into an unmarked black sedan. With a great sense of urgency, Surin started the engine, hit the accelerator and the car peeled away. After a silence, Haddie asked, “Is any of it true? The rumors? Worlds intersecting? The Overlap?”<br><br>Surin didn’t take his eyes off the road as he drove them back to the hotel where their uncle was waiting for them. “I can’t really answer that right now and you need to focus on your next episode. You’re here to investigate the old, abandoned subway station, and I think you should stick to the agenda.”<br><br>“Is it an Overlap?” Jordan asked. “Is that why there were so many accidents? Is that why it was abandoned?”<br><br>Surin hesitated, then nodded gravely.<br><br>“What do you and a billionaire care about the old, subway?” Haddie asked.<br><br>Surin sighed, took a moment to find his words, then answered. “I’m looking for my colleagues. We explored these areas all over the world and a few of us never returned and those that did… they came back to us… lost… confused… insane, even. I want answers. I want to know what happened to the others. I know they’re still alive. They’re lost somewhere… between worlds.”<br><br>“So you’re using us to find them?” Haddie said flatly.<br><br>“We’re helping each other in mutually beneficial ways.”<br><br>Haddie shook her head. “I need to know more. That’s not enough for me.”<br><br>Surin sighed and pulled the sedan over to the shoulder of the road and killed the engine. After a long thoughtful moment, he looked at the siblings in the rear-view mirror and said, “I was undergoing some, let’s say, unorthodox training to enter The Overlap… but it wasn’t possible… it’s like an impossible energy that pulls… I don’t know… hell… pulls hell right out of you… I mean there’s no other way to describe it. What you feel is just pure darkness. But the OSO figured when the mind is developing it can be… it can be fractured… broken in ways so that it rewires itself to withstand the stress of The Overlap.”<br><br>“You turned children into tools!” Jordan spat in disgust.<br><br>Surin looked away from the rear-view mirror and lowered his gaze without answering.<br><br>“And so I’m your new tool,” Haddie said. There was a short silence as Haddie considered her last few investigations. She remembered finding journals in the old asylum that had notes about other realms. Memories of other people trapped in a deathless world and journal entries revealing thoughts about how artists and writers were able to somehow tune into these other worlds with what they believed was their imagination but what was actually their third eye. It was a strange theory that Haddie had dismissed as the ravings of a depraved lunatic with a wild imagination. But something the patient had written had stuck with her.<br><br>The truth is in the story.<br><br>Haddie whispered the words to herself and thought she would give those notebooks another read in case she had missed something. She had them stored in her studio apartment in Montreal and would force Stefan to make a detour before their next investigation.<br><br>“You don’t understand,” Surin continued. “This isn’t just about the friends I lost… There are things in The Overlap we need to understand. There could be a new type of energy… a new way of seeing the world… the universe—”<br><br>Jordan interrupted with a laugh. “Or… there’s nothing there… and it’s just a living hell.”"
Chamber of Blood. The Spiders.,Tome08_Observer,"I have seen them, the spiders, in my mind. They’re coming! They’re coming for us all! Big ones! Small ones! Even giant ones the size of dinosaurs. I see them in my visions charging through the streets bringing truth and understanding to the ignorant.<br><br>But now… now… they’re safe… they’re hiding… hiding in my head and I can feel them crawling through my ear and skull, laying their eggs, nibbling at my nerves and waiting… waiting for the right time to burst out into the world to help humanity achieve transcendence.

Terra Arachna. 1.,Tome08_Observer,105.7 FM. Falls City Radio Classics. I’m Mat Rivers with the latest report we have on the blackouts in the city. Unconfirmed reports describe spider-like creatures attacking the Falls City Power Company. Online rumors suggest a biological terrorist attack unlike anything we’ve seen but no organization has stepped forward to claim responsibility and nothing has been confirmed officially. What we do know is generators at the power company exploded into violent flames taking down powerlines leaving the western sector of the city in the dark. City Police report these unknown creatures attacked several automobiles near the company and are considered extremely dangerous. At least three motorists are dead and four others are in critical condition. Motorists are urged to avoid roads near the power station and the 93 South. That’s the latest we have on the attacks. We’ll keep you informed as the situation develops. We now return to Money-Bake with the latest advice from our financial analyst brought to you by The Now-or-Never Wealth Management Firm… because you can never be sure what the future will bring.
Terra Arachna. 2.,Tome08_Observer,"105.7 FM. Falls City Radio Classics. The spokesperson for the Falls City General Hospital reports an unusual and alarming increase of poison cases due to an unknown spider the size of a fist with bright orange spiral-like markings on its back. The authorities are calling it the hell-back spider and advise you to stay at least two meters away from the spider should you come in contact with one. Federal officials say they are trying to cope with this situation and are still trying to determine if this is in fact a terrorist attack or another phenomenon known as ‘Spontaneous Evolution’ in which new species suddenly appear without any plausible scientific explanation. Other theories suggest a government experiment gone wrong as in the case of the weaponized ticks carrying the human-made Lyme disease variant that escaped from a classified biological warfare laboratory on Apricot Island. The situation seems to be reaching emergency proportions as more and more districts lose power. The city’s coroner’s office says dozens of corpses now reveal the poison from the hell-back spider to be slow and lethal as boils and puss slowly cover the body. There also seem to be indications that some victims go on murderous rampages induced by fever, overactive adrenal glands and what can only be described as a complete loss of sanity. Infected individuals are to be handled with extreme caution until the boils cover the entire body and movement becomes practically impossible. A representative of the Falls City Power Company says they are actively trying to fix the generators to restore electricity but a strange black fog is slowing down repair crews. Anonymous workers at the company are saying on social media that they are hearing strange sounds coming from the fog and believe it may somehow be linked to the spiders. One report claims a worker’s body burst open with spiders after she inhaled the fog. Another report says that before the initial attacks, carcasses of deer were found with thousands if not millions of spiders crawling out of them. I should repeat that… There is a fog and it seems to be carrying microscopic eggs that require a biological host… We advise people to stay calm and take extreme caution if they come in contact with the fog or a hell-back spider. We’ll get back to you with further developments. In the meantime back to Money-Bake brought to you by The Now-or-Never Management Firm… because today’s tragedy is tomorrow’s golden opportunity."
Terra Arachna. 3.,Tome08_Observer,"105.7 FM. Falls City Radio Classics. We are back in the Falls City newsroom. For those of you just tuning in there is a strange disturbance in the area. Spiders of unknown origin of all shapes and sizes seem to be advancing toward residential areas, but authorities are asking everyone to remain calm and that the military is on its way to contain the anomaly. There are reports of similar phenomena in other countries and cities around the world but they have yet to be confirmed. And now we are trying to get whatever information we possibly can to keep you up to speed. And wait… this… this is just in… we have news that a group of teens have barricaded themselves in an abandoned cannery by the docks and are live-streaming attacks from what are clearly spiders the size of dogs. Two of the teens are the sons of our producer Sabrina Malkas. Sabrina’s desperately trying to get in touch with her sons Elias and Elan but can’t… she seems to recognize their friends… Casey… Ariella… Olivia and… she believes… Nina… It seems as though Casey may have inhaled the fog we heard about earlier and is complaining about headaches and nausea… and things crawling under her skin… we’re currently trying to connect to their audio feed to get a better sense of what’s happening out there. Please stand by."
Terra Arachna. 4.,Tome08_Observer,"105.7 FM. Falls City Radio Classics. As of 8 PM, August 7, martial law has been declared. The military will be in charge of security and civil affairs. The military has confirmed a biological attack of an unspecified origin. Spiders that defy classification have attacked our towns, our city, our country. Stay home. Barricade your doors and await further instructions. These spiders are real, and they are deadly. The government will keep you safe and we are doing our best to stop the—<br><br>Ladies and gentlemen we seem to have lost our connection to the White House. But wait… my producer is telling me we have more from the teens barricaded in the old cannery. Elan and Elias confirm Olivia was bitten by a hell-back and has been locked in a room before she becomes a danger to everyone else. The live-feed shows that Casey is swelling all over her body especially in her neck where tiny things seem to be moving under the skin. Nina is missing and what we understand… what we are reading in the comments is… she was pulled outside by a spider and dragged away. Wait… Sabrina tells me that her sons are preparing to go out there to find her. We may be able to connect… hold on… Elan… do you hear me… what’s it like out there… Elan…"
Terra Arachna. Day 987.,Tome09_Observer,"Close call today. Came in contact with the arachnas while testing multiple versions of the toxin. The doctor saw them coming through the window and ordered me to leave everything behind. She said we would return to the lab when the arachnas were gone and it was safe again. We still haven’t found a toxin deadly enough to eliminate these horrible creatures, but I feel we’re close. Very close. If we had a sense of their origins, it would help. As it stands, we still don’t know where they came from or what they want. All we know is the attacks started at the same time. What makes our investigation more challenging is the fact that their DNA is unlike anything we’ve ever encountered. It’s as though… it’s as though they came from another place…"
Terra Arachna. Day 992.,Tome09_Observer,"Returned to the make-shift lab today and found dozens of people wrapped in silk hanging from the ceiling. Blood dripped in sticky pools right under them. I tried to look away as I grabbed the crate of toxins that we had left behind. But as I carried the crate into the corridor, I couldn’t help but notice in the corner of my eye that one of those pods started to move. I forced myself to look and very quickly realized that these pods weren’t filled with food but with something else. It was clear that something was moving and growing inside the cocoon. Something was feeding off the dripping body parts that had been wrapped with it. The groaning creature inside the cocoon struggled to break free, and I instantly rushed out of the lab as fast as my trembling legs could take me. The last thing I wanted was to confront the latest arachna evolution. The arachnas mutate faster than we kill them, and finding the right toxin is our only chance at survival. Let’s hope the doctor and I do so before it’s too late."
Terra Arachna. Day 998.,Tome09_Observer,"Dr. Morell and I worked tirelessly for three days and found a candidate for mass production. Toxin HJ7 killed 100 percent of arachna specimens in less than a minute. One dose and the creatures disintegrated into a thick puddle of bubbling, black tar which very quickly evaporated into a poisonous mist that killed the other arachnas we held in captivity for our experiments. I think both the doctor and I were shocked and amazed at the result. While it is true that we might not know where these monsters came from, we now have a way to eliminate them. The doctor and I are currently looking for ways to get samples of the toxin to other survivors. The office worker turned cook volunteered, but Dr. Morell chose a few other unlikely candidates. She says it’s because he has a track record of messing up his assignments. Personally, I think that’s just an excuse, and the truth is… she’ll miss his cooking… his pizza. Helps her remember better days before the invasion. Helps us all remember better days, I suppose."
Chamber of Blood. The Tale that Follows.,Tome09_Observer,"Constable Duncan J. Smith said thousands of dogs haunted him wherever he went, but no one else saw them. To get away from the dogs he would hide in the crawl space underneath his cabin, or he would hide in the shed where he kept his snowmobile, or sometimes he would escape to the glaciers and hide in the ice caves where he prayed for the howling and the yelping and the whimpering to stop. But the howling and the yelping and the whimpering never stopped, and no matter where he hid, the dogs always found him.<br><br>The first day Duncan saw the dogs was the day he started questioning his job. Or rather, it was the day he started questioning the law and what he was doing with the law. There was something about legally destroying dogs that felt off… that felt… wrong… something that tugged at his heart and wouldn’t let go… something telling him that he needed to get out of the cold, lonely Arctic Archipelago before it was too late—if it wasn’t already too late.<br><br>For Duncan, it was the first time in his career as a police officer that he realized that the law wasn’t always the glorified tool for civilization he had imagined it to be. Sometimes the law was something else. Something blunt. Something hard. Something almost like a gavel… a gavel of destruction or oppression or perhaps both—destruction and oppression.<br><br>Truth is, Duncan wasn’t sure what he was thinking anymore. He was exhausted, and the dogs… well… the dogs just wouldn’t leave him be, and all he wanted to do was return home and farm. He liked working on the farm. Things were simpler on the farm. But here, up north, things were more complicated, and Duncan couldn’t help but think about the law.<br><br>About the gavel.<br><br>And the last thing Duncan wanted to do was wield that gavel against anyone. And yet—to his everlasting regret—he had used it against the dogs.<br><br>And though he had done everything by the book… and though the law said he had committed no crime… his heart continually testified to the opposite.<br><br>To be sure, Duncan had led countless dogs to the bay, where he had shot them like vermin in front of their owners. And it was only when he was alone and surrounded by their ghosts that he would admit to himself that what he had done didn’t feel so right and that maybe… just maybe… these dogs weren’t the dangerous beasts or the diseased rats his captain had made them out to be. They were… well… they were something else.<br><br>They were friends.<br><br>They were family members.<br><br>They played with children, entertained them and kept them safe. They warned against approaching wolves and polar bears, and even snowstorms. And more than anything they made sure no hunter ever got lost in a blizzard unlike those unreliable ‘iron dogs’ or snowmobiles that broke down in the middle of nowhere and left a trail of black smoke across the cold, white, endless expanse. No ‘iron dog’ ever led someone out of a blizzard. The same… well… the same could not be said of the dogs…<br><br>…the dogs he had so heartlessly destroyed.<br><br>But in those days—when the production of the first commercial ‘iron dog’ commenced—there weren’t many challenges to the law, and so Duncan certainly tried to convince himself that he was doing the good and lawful thing for everyone.<br><br>And while it’s true that the mind might not make the difference between what is right and what is lawful, the heart certainly does.<br><br>The heart—it is often said—doesn’t lie.<br><br>Nonetheless, Duncan found ways to trick himself and ignore the appeals of his heart. He told himself these dogs weren’t like other dogs, and he actually believed his lie for a few months. But as time wore on, he very quickly realized that these dogs were… well… like the dogs he had known back home.<br><br>Knowing this made it harder and harder for him to fall asleep, and soon he started to hallucinate and see all the dogs he had shot.<br><br>At first it was just one. Then it was two. Then a dozen. Then a dozen became a hundred. And a hundred became a thousand. A thousand dead dogs howled and stared at Duncan every night, preventing him from sleeping, from dreaming, from thinking—preventing him from living the life he had once known.<br><br>Everywhere Duncan went, there they were, the dogs, looking at him with those eyes—those pleading, confused eyes, wondering what they had done wrong, or how they had failed their family and friends to deserve such a cold and indifferent end.<br><br>Truth is, Duncan couldn’t escape those ghosts any more than a dog could escape its own tail. Wherever he went, there they were, following him, reminding him of all the lives he had disrupted and destroyed with… well… with that gavel.<br><br>One evening, Duncan sat in bed, holding his aching head in his hands, staring at the decaying dogs sitting all around him. They watched him closely as he tried to fall asleep and howled or barked every time his eyelids began to slip. Trembling with fear and exhaustion, Duncan murmured he had done nothing wrong and that he had acted in accordance with the law and that they should just leave him alone. But—<br><br>The dogs wouldn’t leave him alone. They just stared at him in silence with those eyes—eyes that reminded him of his own dog.<br><br>Anguished, Duncan lurched from his bed, screaming at the dogs, telling them he needed to sleep and that he wasn’t going to feel guilty for doing his damn job! He outright refused to apologize or feel guilty for doing what the law required him to do. What the law said he had to do!<br><br>The dogs suddenly stirred anxiously about the cabin with their heads down and tails between their legs. Duncan’s screams grew louder and louder, and one by one, the dogs whimpered and whined for their lives like they had done when they had been destroyed. Then—just like that—they vanished into thin air as though Duncan had finally scared them away.<br><br>When Duncan realized the dogs were gone, he collapsed into his bed and prayed that they should finally leave him alone. He just wanted his life back, for the dogs had robbed him of his strength and freedom and even his sense of identity as a morally upright officer of the law.<br><br>That night, a storm picked up and blew all around his small cabin. Feeling a chill seep through his bones, Duncan rose from the bed, and he made a small fire in the iron stove as he remembered his first and only dog, Buster, a plump Yellow Labrador Retriever with a black snout.<br><br>Smartest, kindest and warmest dog he had ever known.<br><br>To Duncan, Buster was more than just a dog. He was his guardian, his confidant, his best friend. He was the brother he never had. He caught rodents, guarded against coyotes and drove cattle on the farm. His father used to say a good dog was worth two or three farm-hands, and Buster was certainly worth four. Thinking about it now, he was glad that no one ever used the law against Buster, or any other dog in his town for that matter.<br><br>To be sure, Buster wasn’t as big or strong as these Arctic dogs, but he was quite the hunter and had once even saved him from a wolverine. But what Duncan remembered most was that Buster used to curl up in bed with him to calm his anxious heart and help him drift away to sleep.<br><br>And now Duncan longed for nothing more than the undisturbed, soundless sleep of youth. And as he longed for sleep, the wind blew harder and fiercer through the cracks of his cabin. The fire flared, flickered and snapped, casting violent shadows that seemed to tell stories.<br><br>Duncan rubbed his eyes to make the hallucinations go away. But wherever he looked the shadows took the form of officers and hunters shooting at confused and frightened dogs as a thick and unnatural black smoke began to fill the cabin.<br><br>Duncan tried to pinch himself awake. But when he realized he wasn’t asleep, he quickly shut his eyes and once again begged for the dogs to just leave him alone.<br><br>He wanted one night of rest. Just one night! His brain reeled with despair, and he began to hear the warped voice of his captain laughing at him, shouting at him, tormenting him, telling him the dogs were dangerous… aggressive… a definite blight on their future plans.<br><br>Duncan felt madness clutching at the seams of his soul. He screamed that these were lies! All of them! And when he opened his eyes again, the black smoke was gone, and the shadows were once again meaningless shapes flickering about the cabin.<br><br>But just as Duncan sighed his relief, he heard a sound.<br><br>A gentle, scratching sound. At the door. Then he heard a bark that sounded vaguely familiar. The bark came again and again and it sounded like—<br><br>Buster.<br><br>Duncan narrowed his gaze and cautiously approached the thick, wooden door. The scratching stopped just as he placed his hand on the doorknob. He stood in silence for a long, tense moment. When the scratching came again, he quickly opened the door and caught a fleeting glimpse of yellow fur disappearing beyond thick sheets of falling snow.<br><br>Exhausted and confused, Duncan rushed into the churning storm in his undergarments and slippers, yelling for Buster to wait for him. Then he stopped suddenly when he realized he was being irrational. His tired mind was playing tricks on him.<br><br>Buster had been dead for over twenty years. He had been hit by a car. And for a fleeting moment, Duncan remembered holding his paw on the side of the road, calming him down as his life slowly seeped away. He had never cried so much in his life. There was no possible way Buster could still be with him.<br><br>Covered in snow, Duncan told himself the solitude was getting to him and that he just needed one night of undisturbed sleep. He turned back toward the cabin. But as he turned, he realized…<br><br>…he was lost.<br><br>He couldn’t see an inch in front of him in any direction. Cold and panic swept over him at once. He turned and turned as the wind howled and shrieked and whimpered. In the raging blizzard, he could only make out—<br><br>Dogs.<br><br>Ghostly dogs. Dead and decaying dogs. Thousands of them. Running around him. Growling. Howling. Barking. Confusing him.<br><br>Duncan shouted for them to stop, and he tried to scare them off as he had done before. But the dogs grew faster and fiercer as though they were one with the storm.<br><br>Duncan fell to his knees and felt the cold bite all over his trembling body. His face twisted in terror as each dog seemed to pounce out of the storm to take its turn chomping down on him with cold, indifferent teeth. He collapsed to his side in agony. A terrible numbness crept over him, not so much from the cold but the memory of hurting all those poor dogs. He begged for them to stop, and then he did what he had never done before.<br><br>He confessed his shame and begged for forgiveness.<br><br>At once, the dogs froze and stared at him with eyes that seemed to look straight into his heart.<br><br>Duncan choked out that he was sorry, that he was truly sorry, and that even though he had done everything by the book, he had done everything wrong. He had done them wrong. He had done their families wrong. And he had done himself wrong.<br><br>And as he emptied his heart, he heard a familiar bark as Buster suddenly emerged from the ghostly pack and stood before him.<br><br>The dogs looked at Buster, then Duncan, then Buster again. A wave of peace seemed to wash over them as they disappeared one by one and left Duncan with his guardian… his friend… his brother. And Buster curled down beside Duncan as his heart slowed to a stop, and the blinding, white storm swept his life away as it had done so many others.<br><br><br><br>When Constable Duncan J. Smith didn’t show up at the station the next day, his fellow officers searched for him and found his frozen corpse not ten feet from his cabin. He was lying on his side with a peaceful expression on his face. One officer noticed that he had been running around in circles, while the others questioned why he had been foolish enough to leave his cabin in his undergarments in the middle of a snowstorm.<br><br>The captain kneeled by Duncan’s frozen black and blue face and sighed. Just as he ordered someone to cover the body, another officer panicked and rubbed his eyes, claiming he saw dogs all around him. He stumbled back and screamed for the dogs to stay away from him. No one saw what he was seeing, and the captain told him to stop making jokes at Duncan’s expense. But the frantic officer shrieked in terror and swore that the dogs were real and that they were following him."
Arcus 2921.,Tome09_Observer,"Some civilizations collapse because they discover knowledge they aren’t mature enough to understand. Other civilizations collapse because of natural disasters. And yet other civilizations get a little push… a little nudge… over the cliff. I have studied the final days of countless worlds… been through the memories of so many survivors… and I can say that The Entity doesn’t just corrupt and consume a world… it somehow taps into our collective fears and has a little fun. From what I’ve observed The Entity seems to take its time cherry-picking souls from a buffet of misery while contemplating a perfect design of destruction as though… as though an apocalypse was a kind of work of art… a kind of masterpiece. This I realize goes against everything I’ve learned about Ancients back home. But I cannot deny that all the stories and memories I’ve been examining suggest a voluntary and not involuntary will to create and destroy on the part of this Ancient. It’s all speculation at this point but the last realm that opened up in the basement allowed me to venture into Terra Arachna where I witnessed the fall of a world to massive, spider-like creatures—monsters that could have only come from The Entity. Not wanting any of those monsters escaping into the tower, I quickly etched a symbol into the basement door to make the realm disappear. Then, just to be certain, I opened the door and all that was left of the apocalypse was a small, empty room covered in dust. But, as I examined the room, I thought I heard a kind of chittering sound in the corridors. I swallowed a growing lump in my throat and cautiously searched the tower to make sure nothing had escaped. I didn’t find anything inside, but noises outside continue to disturb my sleep, and I’m sure I’ve seen things moving in the fog."
Memory 435,Tome09_Trickster,"Ji-Woon lives within the sounds of Rio de Janeiro. Water splashes into a basin; a skateboard’s wheels grind over asphalt; a rufous-bellied thrush chirps, and… the voice. The angelic, ethereal sound of a young Brazilian man singing floats from an open window. Ji-Woon knows the man. Lucas.<br><br>He’s good. Nowhere near my level, but a diamond, nonetheless.<br><br>His voice is the brush stroke Ji-Woon has been searching for. To think, Lucas practically fell into his lap, the Brazilian man having sung at a recording studio Ji-Woon visited.<br><br>With Lucas' voice, Ji-Woon can create art. Genuine, agonizing art. Silky, bloodcurdling terror.<br><br>Ji-Woon has already prepared a warehouse at an abandoned harbor for tomorrow’s act. Even the most mundane detail required his attention. In the past week he’s transitioned between concert rehearsals to disguising his celebrity visage, staking out his victim, assuming alternate identities, purchasing supplies, and stealing recording equipment—all while paying off his security detail to leave him be. The mundane details are what elevate the splendor of his artwork.<br><br>Lucas will be dead in a day. And it will be beautiful."
Memory 436,Tome09_Trickster,"Ji-Woon freezes as he reaches his hotel room, the door opened a crack. He faintly hears someone rummaging inside. So be it. He knew a crazed fan would take things too far someday. How could they resist him? But he's ready. He'll defend himself, test the invader for operatic sounds, like an impromptu aria, as he surprises them with a blade in their gut.<br><br>He pats the knife concealed above his ankle. Ready. Pushes the door open, steps softly on plush carpet, hears the invader around the corner, sees… Yun-Jin? His manager.<br><br>Fury meets fury.<br><br>How dare you step foot in here!<br><br>Where the hell have you been?<br><br>She's paranoid about death threats they've been getting from a fan. When security couldn't locate Ji-Woon, she came snooping. It's laughable, the threats were nothing but a ploy, a boogeyman he created to throw Yun off his trail if she ever got too close. But he should have expected this. Yun's on top of everything—it's what he respects in her, what makes them a great team. He brings the million-dollar voice and she smashes through any problem in their way. Usually, it works in his favor.<br><br>In her hand she holds… no, damnit! His sampler. It contains his personal project, the screams of his murder victims layered into songs. It's an early draft lacking subtlety, the violence and horror a bit too blatant for the faint of heart. She's disgusted. Couldn't hear beyond the terrorized voices to understand the beauty inherent in human suffering. The hairs on Ji-Woon's neck stand on end. He sees the moment with clear eyes: they're dancing on a razor's edge, with Yun dangerously close to discovering who he truly is."
Memory 437,Tome09_Trickster,"Yun holds the sampler as if it's dripping blood. The only solace in Ji-Woon's mind is that she doesn't understand what it really is. He knows her. If she thought the sounds were actual murders, she'd have tried to knee him in the crotch and run. But the anger still rattles through her, as she moves up to his face.<br><br>What is this twisted horror bullshit? What if this leaked? You're already attracting crazed, violent fans, how would it look if the media heard the demented sounds you're working on? Mightee One would drop you. Your career would be dead.<br><br>Ji-Woon knows what she really fears: her career would be dead. For as tall as she stands, as strong as she swings, she's nothing but a scared girl afraid of failure. He knows how to play her. Drops his head, breathes deeply, wipes the back of his hand over his eyes.<br><br>Yun… Ever since the death of No Spin… the fire… I'm riddled with horrid thoughts. I lost my friends and… I fear I'm losing my mind. I see awful things behind closed eyes. All that guides me through the dark fog is turning my pain into sound… pouring the throes of death from my heart to a song.<br><br>Yun's face softens. She sits. Commiserates with him. Inside, he's reliving the divine screams of his bandmates as they burned, his swelling heart as they screamed his name, but on his face he shows nothing but contortions of tragedy.<br><br>She excuses his error in judgment. Confiscates the sampler. Requests he stay on hotel grounds until the concert is over. It's for his own good. His safety. She tells him to get a drink from the mini-bar and cool down.<br><br>He quietly nods and complies, reminding himself to steal back the sampler in a few days. He lets her pretend she has what he's holding: control."
Memory 438,Tome09_Trickster,"Despite the stifling humidity, Ji-Woon hides under a hoodie, large sunglasses concealing his face. Now's not the time to attract attention from rabid fans. He waits till Yun is in a meeting and strolls out of the hotel, a bag of necessities in hand. It's his show now.<br><br>He pulls earbuds from his pocket, allows the music to envelope him. The song: How I Became, recorded six months ago in Seoul. It stands as a metaphor for his childhood, written one drunken night while looking over old photographs.<br><br>He is seven years old. He sits at the back of the class. He's uncomfortable being seen and speaking. But today is different. In a few minutes he's presenting on his favorite thing. A young boy shows the class his hamster, but Ji-Woon doesn't care. He holds his flute, going over the notes to the song he wrote.<br><br>He shuffles to the front of the class, places his sweaty fingers on the instrument. Following a deep, unsteady breath, he gently blows out a wisp of air, creating a light, whimsical sound. He closes his eyes, moves his fingers precisely, playfully dancing over each note. He ignores the squeaks of the hamster. The flute's sound carries like chimes in the wind. With one final soul-piercing note, he smiles and opens his eyes. His classmates are huddled around the rodent, laughing with its every move. His teacher too.<br><br>He walks to the group. Students pass the hamster around as it squeaks incessantly. It finds itself directed into Ji-Woon's palm. He takes it in both hands. With one steady movement, he squeezes. A squeal. A slight crunch. No more sound. The children scream. Ji-Woon feels nothing."
Memory 439,Tome09_Trickster,"Storm clouds overtake the sky as the first drops of rain spatter onto Ji-Woon's sunglasses. He breathes deeply, prepares for what he's played over in his mind. The anticipation nearly brings him to his knees. The joy of the artistic process.<br><br>He strides to the rear door of a cheap 1980's sedan, glances both ways and appraises the few locals walking the street. Certain no one's watching, he jams a straightened coat hanger around the top of the window, pushing it through the other side. His thin fingers work quickly. Prior experience in breaking and entry pays off. He hooks the wire around the door lock and flicks it up. Without missing a beat, he slides inside, closes the door, and flattens himself along the backseat. He takes off his hoodie and sunglasses.<br><br>From his bag he pulls out rope, a blade, a dusty rag, and a bottle of chloroform. He waits. Takes out his earbuds. Listens to a song that's not his own. One he heard long ago.<br><br>He is eight years old. He sits on his father's shoulders, looking over a sea of human bodies. An elaborate stage is ahead, illuminated by colored spotlights. A man in gaudy, audacious clothing stands in front of a microphone. On each side is a guitarist, behind him, a drummer. A crash of sound. Beautiful, rhythmic music. A voice that twists delicately through the melody.<br><br>His father shouts something but he can't hear. Shouts again.<br><br>This is what you'll do. This is where your talent will take you.<br><br>He feels a tingle through his spine, and sees something incredible: everyone enraptured, focused intently on the sound of a single man. The emotion of thousands is guided by his voice. He is seen by all, he is loved, and he is wonderous.<br><br>Ji-Woon never played his flute again. He reveled in sounds that reached global audiences, attracted screaming fans, turned men and women into idols. His childhood fear vanished as he learned to divulge himself through the intricacy and pliability of pop, his inner thoughts riding atop soundwaves, fusing together with other genres—rock, hip hop, jazz, punk. It was the music that could deliver him the explosive fame he deserved, a promise that he would never be upstaged. He was no longer confined to his timid shell; he revealed himself through his mastery of music, poured his heart into sound. He became envied, lusted over, and respected for the hits that spilled from his lungs.<br><br>He takes the earbuds in his hands and smiles. How miraculous that a boy became a god."
Memory 440,Tome09_Trickster,"Rain hammers down on the car's roof. Ji-Woon checks the time. On any other day, Lucas would be in his car already. He knows this, he's done his homework. But Lucas is late, and Ji-Woon wonders if the storm has altered plans.<br><br>He feels control slipping away, replaced by something else. It pushes against his chest. Forces him to gasp for air, heavy and sticky in his lungs. Everything's ruined. He claws his nails into the car seat, forces his mouth shut to keep himself from screaming. All the planning for nothing. He doesn't have time before leaving Brazil to find another beautiful voice. Quickly… he needs music, fumbles for his earbuds, drops them to the floor, frantically scours. The only song playing is his teeth audibly grinding. As he prepares to spill into the street, he sees him. Lucas, drenched under the deluge, walks to the driver's side door.<br><br>Get your shit together. The show's about to begin.<br><br><b>***</b><br><br>Ji-Woon grabs Lucas' neck in a chokehold, shoves the chloroform-soaked cloth into his face. The two struggle in a frenzied dance. Lucas twists from side to side, reaching his arms back, grabbing for anything. Ji-Woon resists the movement, holding the man in place with all his might. Rain smashes down, muting the battle under the pattering of a hundred drops, concealing the outside behind a windshield of streaming water. Lucas grabs a handful of hair and pulls Ji-Woon forward, breaking the chokehold. He bites deep into Ji-Woon's wrist, drawing blood. Ji-Woon screams through gritted teeth, pushing the cloth harder into Lucas' face until he's beating him with it. Lucas flails his other arm in a desperate bid, searching for a solution with no plan. His hand relaxes, releasing Ji-Woon's hair. He slumps forward, head hitting the steering wheel, blasting the horn.<br><br>Ji-Woon scurries over the seat, pushes Lucas' limp body to the passenger side. He leans back, takes a moment to catch his breath. Looks in the rearview mirror, inspects his face, hair, and, through a sheet of rain, sees a sight he never expected: Yun's car pulling up behind him.<br><br>He grabs the keys from Lucas' pocket, jams them in the ignition and slams the accelerator down."
Memory 441,Tome09_Trickster,"Lucas' limp body jostles back and forth in the passenger seat. Streetside shops and graffitied walls are a blur as Ji-Woon veers around a corner. Wind and rain lash at the city as if dead-set on blowing it apart. Ji-Woon loses track of his plan. Usually, he would have Yun fix his problems, but now—it's all wrong. He doesn't recognize the streets he's speeding down, only has a vague idea of the direction. Yun remains on his tail. She doesn't know when to quit. The tenacity and courage that proved useful when negotiating his record deal is infuriating now. He's losing control of his artistic process. Hands squeeze the wheel. He'd rip it from the steering column if he could.<br><br>No… no! You're not going down like this. You have art to make, damnit.<br><br>He flicks on the radio. Two men talking about… something. He doesn't know. Searches the channels—a commercial for a fast-food restaurant. Recognizes the jingle. Keeps going, lands on—there it is, Brazilian dance music. Rapid tempo, heavy bass line, percussive guitar notes, and a smooth voice.<br><br>He pushes the pedal to the floor, dodges a few kids playing in the storm. Bolts past an old pickup truck, praying no one comes the other way. Swings the wheel hard to the left, nearly loses control in deep water but recovers to find himself in a perfect turn. Guns it as the song hits the chorus. Trusts in the music. Shifts with the tempo. Slides with the riffs. Feels the beauty in everything he does. Music courses through him. He is living art. He is the crescendo.<br><br>Behind him, Yun's car comes to a crashing halt.<br><br>It doesn't matter. The music goes on."
Memory 442,Tome09_Trickster,"Ji-Woon pulls into the harbor he'd staked out days ago. He reluctantly turns off the radio and scans the area. No sign of Yun behind him but he's on his guard. Somehow she knew how to find him. He pulls out his phone… his Mightee One company phone.<br><br>She's tracking me like an overzealous babysitter. Should have expected this from her… always a micromanager.<br><br>But she couldn't have known he was driving the car—only that he was in it.<br><br>Ji-Woon drags out Lucas, barely conscious, and pushes a blade into this back. Before shutting the door, he takes his phone and texts a simple message to Yun: HELP. He tosses the device on the car seat along with the rag of chloroform and rope. Hm, needs more evidence. He cuts his palm and presses a bloody hand to the window. That'll do.<br><br>With a thrust of his blade, he pushes Lucas forward.<br><br><b>***</b><br><br>Thunder shakes the frame of the abandoned warehouse. Lucas sits in front of Ji-Woon, bound to a chair, ready to be slaughtered, to sing, to create beauty. Ji-Woon pulls out his blade but… hesitates. Something's wrong. He was too messy getting here. He wants to dive into his art, let the blood spill, but Yun threw him off his game. He can't shake the feeling; he knows she doesn't give up easily… or at all. Walks over to a window and looks out. Endless rain. Lightning. And there, like a drowned rat skulking through sewage—Yun. So damn persistent. And further back… the flashing lights of a police car. Yun's stumbled into a bloody game and has the power to end him in one move.<br><br>He rummages through his pockets for his earbuds. Can't find them. Can't focus. Feels the plan slipping away. Sees an end to his art. The music cut short. His vision incomplete.<br><br>No… he can't let it end. He hears the music. It's always been there. Sitting on his father's shoulders, washing over him. He inhales it. It circulates through his veins. Becomes him. He'll never go back to being the boy he once was. He's an idol. He's a god. He's The Trickster. And he has one last trick to play…"
Memory 443,Tome09_YunJin,"Fatigued from the long flight, Yun-Jin yawns as she turns on her laptop. She landed in Rio De Janeiro just two hours ago, but her work cannot wait. Looking through her mailbox, she spots a dozen unread emails from an unknown user addressing her by name. Few know her as Yun-Jin. Most only know her as Magnum Opus. She clicks on an email.<br><br>A graphic, detailed description of someone's plan to murder her and the Trickster. Signed, the Trickster's number one fan. Death threat. An abnormally specific one with a picture of her in the hotel lobby.<br><br>Before the death of NO SPIN, she ignored such threats. But now… her manicured hand shake as she reaches for her phone.<br><br>The threat is too serious to be taken lightly. She calls her security crew for an emergency meeting. Outings are restricted to recording sessions and concert rehearsals only. A bodyguard is assigned to the Trickster and herself.<br><br>Everyone complies with the new rules except for the Trickster, who argues against staying on the hotel premises. No surprises there. Her relationship with the Trickster has been on the rocks for months now. He challenges every decision she makes, his ego pushing her patience to its limit. Because of their frequent creative disagreements, their next album is behind schedule, forcing her to produce three new songs while overseeing his tour.<br><br>Her security expert confirms that the phones are ready. At her request, a tracking GPS application was installed on all company phones. No one else knows about this. If the Trickster keeps testing her patience, this app will come in handy. It's for his own good. And hers."
Memory 444,Tome09_YunJin,"Yun-Jin pours herself a cup of coffee at the recording studio, stifling another yawn. Her temples are throbbing. The jet lag is hitting her hard. Plus the constant threat of a crazed fan prevents her from getting any sleep at night.<br><br>On her way back to the booth, she notices that the studio next to theirs is occupied. She peeks inside. A young man is laughing in the recording booth. He has an easy-going smile that could sell thousands of magazines. She recognizes the man at the mix table: Allano Muse, a semi-famous producer from San Diego.<br><br>What is he doing in Rio? Some bits of fresh gossip could help reenergize her. She taps on the door's window.<br><br>The door creaks open.<br><br>He remembers her of course. Who could forget the Magnum Opus?<br><br>She invites herself in as he plays the track he is working on. A slow, predictable build for the baseline. Formulaic. Too safe to be of any interest. Then, an ethereal voice fills the room. Yun-Jin almost spills her coffee. The artist's voice is crystalline. His range is powerful yet nuanced.<br><br>Who is that?<br><br>Allano tells Lucas, the young artist, to drop down his pitch a notch. Bad call. The track should be building up to push Lucas' range instead of confining it to a boring, generic sound. She walks up to Lucas and hands him her business card.<br><br>Contact me when you're ready to become a serious artist.<br><br>A pang of regret hits her on her way out. She said those exact words to the Trickster, many years ago. Back then, she looked forward to working with him.<br><br>Those days are long gone."
Memory 445,Tome09_YunJin,"At the hotel bar, Yun-Jin takes a sip of her cold Caipirinha, the sugarcane liquor smoothening the sour burst of lime.<br><br>Why did she give that young artist, Lucas, her business card? It's not like she can produce him. Another pang of nostalgia. Another sip of Caipirinha. She misses it. Hunting new talents. The raw creative chaos of designing a bold sound. The adrenaline rush of the first album. Things are different now. Her time is split between handling the Trickster's growing ego, and following a generic, endless production cycle.<br><br>Is this the cost of success? Producing music that makes her cringe? Not to mention handling arguments about bodyguards and curfews while being threatened by a crazed, psychotic fan.<br><br>Her life is so different from what she imagined as a little girl. Back then, music was the only good thing she had. She created tracks in her bedroom, imagining a stage of bright lights where she was safe, loud, and free. That is what Pop music is to her: a vital dose of unapologetic release. But now, thanks to her success, she lives in a golden cage.<br><br>Down goes the Caipirinha.<br><br>The bartender gives her a glance and she nods. Keep them coming.<br><br>She calls Mightee One executives for a virtual meeting and gives them the news. Once she finishes the three tracks in Rio, she is done with the Trickster. She will move on to producing the launch of trainees.<br><br>A Mightee One executive cuts her off. They have more urgent business to discuss. Damaging rumors are trending online. A disturbed, delusional fan claims to have murdered someone at a Trickster concert. Yun-Jin closes her fists, her long manicured nails digging into her palms. Anything to keep her hands from shaking again.<br><br>She will handle this mediatic storm—for her brand's sake. But after Rio, she is done with the Trickster. Whether Mightee One is willing or not."
Memory 446,Tome09_YunJin,"Online, rumors about the murder are trending. An anonymous post claims that the victim was last seen alive at the Trickster's VIP meet-up after his concert in New York early this year. Yun-Jin remembers that night. Not because of the concert, but because of a detail that has been replaying in her mind ever since. Bleeding scratch marks on the Trickster's forearms when he showed up at the concert’s afterparty. The rumors online were rekindling the suspicion she silenced before.<br><br>Years ago, the Trickster and she arrived in Miami several days earlier than planned. Yun-Jin attended networking events while the Trickster rehearsed. Three days following their arrival, a folksinger was found dead downtown, near the bar where he performed. A security footage was released to the public showing a man dressed in black with his face covered, leading the singer down an alley. The dark, blurry footage revealed little about the suspect. But Yun-Jin noticed a detail that twisted her stomach in knots. She recognized the gold rimmed headphones around the suspect’s neck with two large “Xs”, one for each ear. It was the brand-new model of the Xerxes 1050x headphones, which few audiophiles knew about and even fewer could afford. She recognized the model right away because the Trickster favored their equipment over other expensive models. He wore a similar pair on the plane to Miami, but then switched to a lesser model for the rest of the tour, which only fueled her doubts.<br><br>Back then, however, she was not in a good place. The death of NO SPIN was still fresh. Acute insomnia kept her mind in a haze and the jet lag of the tour only worsened her state. In the end, she decided to let the police do their job and focus on hers; producing music. But now someone else was dead, someone whom the Trickster might have been the last one to see alive. The headphones, the scratch marks, and the late-night outs were details, but they added up.<br><br>How many coincidences does it take to know?<br><br>A knock on the door makes her jump. The head of security is here. Yun-Jin follows her gut. She confronts him. She bluffs about firing the whole security crew if he does not come clean. It pays off. She learns that the Trickster left the hotel premises last night. His bodyguard tried to follow but lost him on the way.<br><br>Yun-Jin pounds her fist on the table.<br><br>Why would he leave the hotel? To go where? And… to do what?<br><br>Despite working with the Trickster for years, he is still no more than a stranger. While he generates incredible profit, it comes at a cost. If the Trickster is linked to a murder, so is she. Even if there is no evidence. Even if it’s just rumors. It’s her life on the line. Her entire career. She could never produce music again. And the worst part is… it's her own fault. She knows better than to trust someone in this industry.<br><br>She needs to get answers, before it is too late. Whatever the Trickster is doing at night, she must find out. Her doubts won’t be quieted until she knows for certain."
Memory 447,Tome09_YunJin,"Yun-Jin leaves her security detail behind during the Trickster's rehearsal. What she is up to is not strictly legal, after all.<br><br>She shows her VIP badge at the doorman and enters the Trickster's changing room. Perhaps she could find something in here that could be a clue as to what the Trickster is up to. Amidst the flamboyant costumes, she looks for a clue: receipts, notes, pictures. All she finds is a gym bag.<br><br>Inside lies a water bottle, a few t-shirts, and his wallet. No bills or anything of interest in his wallet… except for his hotel room keycard. Perhaps she is looking in the wrong place. Someone chatting loudly on the side of the door alerts her. She snatches the hotel keycard and zips up the bag just as the Trickster's assistant walks in.<br><br>Yun-Jin quells her thudding heart and keeps her expression impassive as she walks out. Whatever the assistant saw, she will not dare mention it, at least not to anyone who matters.<br><br>Yun-Jin only pauses when she reaches the Trickster's hotel room, keycard in hand. If she does this, there is no turning back. Yet if the Trickster is hiding something, she needs to know what it is, before everyone else does. Before it ruins her life. There can be no doubts. Yun-Jin pushes the door open.<br><br><b>***</b><br><br>The Trickster's room is tidy. Almost as if he barely spends time here. She goes through his luggage. A pile of odd clothes.

Come back later.<br><br>She finds nothing odd in the room, except for a rare, top-of-the-line sampler on his bedside table. Intrigued, she presses play. A series of loud, violent screams fill the room. The screeches sound… genuine. Samples from a horror film?<br><br>Yet she cannot fully shake her initial, disturbing thought. What if it is… genuine?<br><br>What she finds next only enhances her discomfort. A sharpening kit for knives. Wet stones and cleaning products. A whole collection of sharpeners.<br><br>A past conversation overheard at the recording studio replays in her mind. Lucas, the young artist, introducing himself to the Trickster, asking about the flamboyant knife in his hands. The Trickster replying that he always keeps a blade on him.<br><br>Yun-Jin picks up a wet stone. Why sharpen a stage prop? Sure, the Trickster used real knives to do stunt work as a kid, but it is no longer necessary. This obsession with knives is not just for show. And what is the point of sharpening a knife if it's not to use it? She shudders.<br><br>Another noise at the door. Yun-Jin puts down the wet stone.<br><br>I said come back la--<br><br>Trickster walks into the room, catching her off guard. Her eyes meet his.<br><br>He is just the awkward kid I signed years ago. I will not let him drag me down.<br><br>His outrage meets her fury. Yun-Jin picks up the sampler.<br><br>Where the hell do you wander off at night? And what is this twisted horror bullshit? What if the media got ahold of it? Your career would be over.<br><br>Trickster sighs and admits that after the death of NO SPIN, his mind drifted to a dark place. He rarely talks about their death, and she can tell why. That day still haunts her dreams. Time passes, but guilt remains.<br><br>Yun-Jin spots his phone on the table.<br><br>Grab a drink from the mini bar, Trickster. Today's rehearsal is canceled.<br><br>She keeps the sampler and reminds him to stay on hotel grounds until the concert. He nods in agreement.<br><br>Good.

There is something off about the Trickster, a hunch she can no longer ignore, no matter how profitable he is. While he might seem sincere, years in the business have taught her that she cannot trust anyone.<br><br>Yun-Jin grabs her phone and activates the GPS tracker on the Trickster's company phone.

Unless… the Trickster is not the one she is chasing.<br><br>Yun-Jin's heart skips a beat. The death threat. The Trickster's number one fan. Perhaps the crazed fan found out about the Trickster's nightly escapades and decided to strike. Kidnappings go hand-in-hand with death threats after all.<br><br>She lets out a curse. In her rush to chase the Trickster, she left her bodyguard behind. If anything happens to the Trickster, Ji-Woon, and she was too blind to stop it… No. She has enough guilt on her conscience already.<br><br>Yun-Jin re-adjusts her seatbelt.

The elections are tonight.<br><br>Several sheets slide over the printer's tray, falling at Amanda's feet. She snatches them from the ground. Earlier today, she broke into Grace’s inbox to find her flaw. The test must be perfect. Perhaps John will be able to rest once he is convinced that his life's work is in capable hands.<br><br>Amanda pores over a series of documents and emails exchanged between Grace and a lawyer from ten years ago. A certain Ben Fairfax threatened to expose a scandal relating to when Grace joined the city council. The lawsuit was settled swiftly.<br><br>But the emails continued between Grace and her lawyer. Amanda found a report showing that Zanix industries, a copper exporter in the area, poured waste directly into the Hillford river, contaminating the ground water. The city's decayed, century-old water lines were unable to filter the filth. Grace covered up the lawsuit to avoid adding to the city’s increasing taxes. For ten years, filth has been poured into the water of Grace’s oblivious voters.<br><br>Amanda looks down at the glass of water sitting on her desk.<br><br>She dumps it into the sink and grabs a bottle of vodka from the freezer.

Arcus 27,Tome10_03,"Most of the fiction featuring Haddie and Jordan end with one of the siblings disappearing, which accounts for some of the contradicting memories I’ve discovered in the fog. I believe there are several actual Haddies and Jordans stuck here with all the others. The memories I’ve studied so far conflict with one another so that they rarely line up with each other or the fictional stories I found in the Chamber of Blood. However, I must always remember that the collected stories and artwork in the chamber are interpretative, they are not exact, and they were more or less inspired by several versions of the siblings that exist or will exist or have existed within the endless tapestry that is the omniverse.<br><br>The truth is… The Unknowns have collected so many stories that I don’t know where to begin my research. Currently, I am focusing on The Redcrane and Twelve to Midnight to better understand how the black fog works and how the characters in these stories may have been able to interact with it to their advantage. There are also many versions of Dejavuism that relate a story of how one man found a way into the darkest recesses of this dimension to save the one he loved. But the story doesn’t go into the details of how he managed to find a way in, and I will have to go through other versions of the story to see if there is any information that can help me. Better yet, I am hoping to find his actual memories within the fog to give me a sense of how he found a way into this realm."
Chamber of Blood. Dejavuism.,Tome10_03,"It was a book club, and they were arguing over the latest Edwin Cain novel along with the interview the author had given where he discussed a concept he had called Dejavuism. He put forward the theory that our brains are biological, quantum computers with vast networking abilities beyond our current understanding of physics. Cain believed that our quantum brains could connect to other beings with similar frequencies within the multiverse as though they were inter-dimensional cellphones. The club members, who discussed these theories and how they sometimes felt their inner voice was another version of themselves advising them from another time or place, began telling stories about instincts, gut feelings, and deja-vu experiences that felt all too real. There was one skeptic who scoffed at the idea of the multiverse. He thought the idea was ridiculous comic book nonsense, and he laughed at the very notion that our brains were interconnected, multidimensional computers that received or projected ideas from the ether.<br><br>One woman exclaimed:<br><br>“It could be true. Such a theory would help us understand why ideas seem to come to us as a group, or why so many similar ideas seem to bubble up all over the world at pretty much the same time. Who’s to say we aren’t all tapping into the same stream of ideas.”<br><br>The skeptic answered:<br><br>“It’s just coincidence. That’s all it is when a bunch of people from different places come up with similar ideas. And coincidence has nothing to do with the multiverse or other versions of ourselves in the universe.”<br><br>Another man shook his head and said:<br><br>“I don’t really agree. There’s shit out there we just don’t understand, and I recently read the idea for Wi-Fi and cellphones came from a bunch of scientists trying to understand a gland in our brain. A gland that’s bioluminescent and seems to be searching for signals. Granted this could be online misinformation, but what is true, and what many cultures believe is that our artists can tap into things not of this world. What I found interesting was how Cain said these visions that artists receive are only accessible to those who experience trauma when they’re young, those who have been bullied, abused, exiled… those who have learned to shut out their reality for self-protection in order to fully experience other realities.”<br><br>A woman added:<br><br>“The door to the physical world closes, the door to another world opens.”<br><br>The skeptic laughed and was just about to speak when another woman, an aspiring storyteller, interrupted him and said:<br><br>“I get visions and dreams about the same place all the time. One of my recurring dreams is of Romulus and how he is taken up by a massive black storm cloud and brought to this dark realm where he’s chased by a hideous creature… a monster that could not possibly exist. What’s strange is he’s not alone. He’s not the only being hunted. He’s with a biker and two other Scottish men who at first I thought were sailors, but then I had this other dream that showed me that they were, in fact, lighthouse keepers. I did some research and I could swear by the pictures that the biker I was seeing was Yui Kimura, the one who disappeared a few years ago.”<br><br>The skeptic laughed and said:<br><br>“So what your saying is the Emperor of Rome wasn’t assassinated by his generals but is somehow stuck in some kind of demented world with Yuri Kimura and two lighthouse keepers. This, you somehow believe, is real. Romulus and Yui are running from a monster as we sip coffee and tea in our cozy chairs and talk books and authors. This is what you’re putting forward as something possible? Something reasonable for all of us to believe?”<br><br>A woman said:<br><br>“It sounds a bit out there. But maybe there are things in the cosmos that are beyond reason or science.”<br><br>Another woman beamed at the aspiring storyteller and said:<br><br>“Real or not, you should write a story for your blog or even for your next performance. I think it would be a lot of fun, even if it does require a little suspension of disbelief.”<br><br>The aspiring storyteller smiled and answered:<br><br>“Actually, I have a draft I’ve been working on, which I wanted to share with the group before I posted it. I’m still not sure if it’s a story I can perform because it’s a bit complicated and messy, but maybe you can help me find ways to energize and simplify it.”<br><br>Everyone nodded enthusiastically, except for the skeptic who rolled his eyes.<br><br>The storyteller pulled out a coffee stained notebook and opened it to a story that she still hadn’t titled. She took a deep, calming breath and began:<br><br>“This story doesn’t have a title but I’m thinking of calling it The Tragedy of Cliff and Alex, who were real people and who disappeared before most of us were born. Now, I’m not one to believe in conspiracy theories or urban legends but their story, which I acquired through extensive interviews and research opened my mind to the possibility that there is more to our lives than that which can be seen or proven.”<br><br>The skeptic quipped:<br><br>“Well, that’s convenient, isn’t it?”<br><br>The storyteller ignored his comment and continued:<br><br>“Love, for example, exists and ceases to exist just as soon as we indulge in proofs and evidence. As soon as there is doubt… as soon as there is a need for proof… love is dead. And yet, we know love is a real. And we know—don’t we—that love is quite unreasonable. It’s powerful. It’s maddening. And we hate that we can’t define it. Love exists, and it doesn’t need to be proven in any way, shape or form for it to be real—” the storyteller made an exaggerated gesture to grab something in the empty air—”And yet, just as soon as you try to grasp it—it tatters at the touch.<br><br>“Cliff Barra always loved horror movies. He started making scary movies when his father bought him his first Super 8 camera. And so it comes to no surprise that he grew up to be a famous director who translated his favorite gothic novels and horror stories to the silver screen. It’s also no surprise that when he met Alex Damaro, an equally famous art director known for his brilliant and visionary production sets and costume designs, that they were instantly smitten with one another. Together, it`s safe to say, they produced some of the scariest and most iconic films to date. But all this changed when Alex suddenly disappeared while on set in a rolling cloud of black fog the crew insisted they had not designed.<br><br>“From that point on, the movies stopped. A great heaviness came over Cliff as he found himself confronted by the horror that he would never see Alex again. He turned his back on his friends, his career, his life, and he became possessed by an obsession to find out what had happened to Alex. Investigations into this strange fog led him to a group of people searching for missing loved ones. With this group he learned about the existence of secret cults and societies that understood the black fog and the strange realm from which it came. He dug deeper and deeper, discovering his old movie set wasn’t haunted as everyone said it was… but was… a kind of doorway to another realm. So he returned to the haunted movie set where Alex disappeared and waited… and waited… He waited for days until finally he heard Alex’s laughter, and with the laughter came the fog. And the fog rolled in and carried him away.<br><br>“And so, Cliff ended up in another world that defied his wildest nightmares. He followed Alex’s voice through a darkness that had never known the light of day. At last, he came upon a forest of wooden stakes bearing skewered heads. He picked his way through the stakes, inspecting each head. The scene reminded him of one of the first films he had made as a teenager. He soon came to one head that resembled an old producer friend of his. Suddenly, the eyes sprang open, and Cliff started. At once, all the heads came alive, taunting and ridiculing him like he had been ridiculed as a child for his passions and hobbies.<br><br>""But Cliff stayed the course despite the insults and the taunts that he would never see Alex again. One head of the thousands shouted louder than the rest. The head screamed that Alex was being corrupted and that he should turn back before it was too late. Realizing this severed head knew more than the rest, Cliff kicked the stake and caught the head as it toppled off. The head protested and yelled that it had once been a king and it didn’t want to be in the hands of a commoner. And Cliff promised the king he would release him after—and only after—he helped him find Alex.<br><br>“Long story short, the head lead Cliff to the edge of a massive gate that surrounded a town that resembled every production set Alex had ever designed for Cliff. Before he could take in the area, he suddenly heard Alex screaming in the distance. The king warned Cliff not to interfere with the process and explained that Alex was being twisted and tortured into a brutal, murdering monster for reasons they would never understand.<br><br>“But Cliff couldn’t bear to hear Alex suffer. Every agonizing scream was a dagger in his heart. And so, dropping the head, he climbed over the gate and, unperturbed by the formless creatures moving in the fog, he followed the cries to the top of a castle he recognized from his Frankenstein film. Cliff charged up the winding stairs to the roof, where he found Alex agonizing on a metal table as bolts of lightning struck him every few moments from a thick, black storm cloud. All around him in glass prisons filled with formaldehyde were all the monsters Alex had ever designed since he was a child. Cliff couldn’t believe what he wasn’t seeing. It was as if this living nightmare were all a projection of their combined memories.<br><br>“Cliff didn’t even try to understand what was happening or what he was experiencing. Without hesitation, he rushed up to Alex not knowing what to do. In the shadows he spotted an ax on the cobblestone floor and instantly grabbed it. Then, despite the deadly lightning, he pushed through the sizzling and sparking pain to smash the chains that bound Alex to the table. Alex opened his half-conscious eyes with difficulty. He barely recognized Cliff. Alex squinted with charred eyelids and managed to murmur words that made Cliff smile. Then Cliff hefted Alex over his shoulders and charged down the stairs and out into the thickening fog where frantic, formless creatures did all they could to prevent them from escaping.<br><br>“Cliff kicked, punched and charged through the fog, smashing through creatures, crows, and claws—everything and anything the world set against him. He remembered the king telling him something about a hatch—the hatch would somehow lead to freedom. Desperately, Cliff searched the ground as he heard a roar followed by a clap of thunder. Pounding steps chased him through the darkness. He didn’t even bother to look back. He rushed forward until he saw it! The glint of metal by a crumbling Gargoyle statue from one of his movies. He ran to the hatch, opened it, and lowered Alex to safety. Then, just as he was about to descend, something sharp like talons clutched his ankles and pulled him screaming into the raging fog!<br><br>“I’d like to say that it all worked out in the end and that they lived happily ever after. But that’s not the truth of this story. The truth is Cliff took Alex’s place at the torturer’s table and was turned into a perfect champion of horror with little or no memory of who he was or how he ended up in this dark realm. And Alex… well… He ended up with a group of stranded souls who did whatever they could just to survive. But that’s another story for another time. Suffice to say that love torments all—bringing the best and worst out of us when we least expect it.”<br><br>The storyteller finished and everyone was silent and inward, thinking about what they had sacrificed for love and what they would sacrifice for love. But not the skeptic. No, the skeptic was turning the story over and over in his head searching for issues. At last, he broke the silence, asking:<br><br>“What happened to the head? The talking head? Cliff just drops the king’s head and then you never hear about it again. It kind of makes the story incomplete.”<br><br>A woman blurted out:<br><br>“Who cares about the damn head? It’s a love story!”<br><br>The skeptic added:<br><br>“Also, I don’t think you can use 'tatters' as a verb.”<br><br>The storyteller smiled and politely said:<br><br>“I’m still working the story, and the ideas are still coming to me in my dreams. I’ve been logging them in my notebooks and I’ll re-read the current version more critically to see if I need to do something else with the talking head.”<br><br>Another woman said:<br><br>“All that horror, and for what? To end up twisted and tortured and turned into some abomination worse than anything he ever filmed. I feel so bad for him.”<br><br>A man said:<br><br>“I don’t. Not because I don’t like him as a character, but because that’s just the kinda things we do for love—the horrible and the beautiful, the bitter and the sweet, the euphoria and the madness—” he lost himself in a memory for a moment—”Love twists and torments. And I’m sure there’s nothing that dark world can do to anyone that would surpass the torment of not knowing what had happened to a loved one… or worse… the regret of knowing what had happened and not doing anything.”<br><br>Another man said:<br><br>“Well, I do hope you publish this story on your blog. I found it heartbreaking and terrifying… and I guess I’m wondering if you really think this is what happened to the real Cliff and Alex.”<br><br>The storyteller shrugged and closed her notebook as she prepared to leave. She wasn’t sure what she believed anymore.<br><br>The skeptic laughed and said:<br><br>“I’ll tell you what I think. I think the real Cliff and Alex faked their disappearance to get out of the limelight, and they moved far, far away to some gorgeous, exotic island where they’re eating grapes, drinking margaritas, and living happily ever after.”<br><br>The man said:<br><br>“Well, I do hope you’re right and the story is just a story. But if you’re not… well… I hope Alex will one day be able to do for Cliff what Cliff did for him.”<br><br>A woman said:<br><br>“It kind of makes you wonder if the characters we read about in the books are actually real somewhere.”<br><br>Another woman said:<br><br>“A story in this world, reality in another.”<br><br>The storyteller stood, smiled at all the book club members, and excused herself as she had an early shift at the café. Everyone said goodbye, watched her disappear out the door, and then returned to their discussion about Edwin Cain, Dejavuism, and the story they had just heard."
Chamber of Blood. Day of Night. Mahan Singh. 1.,Tome10_03,"Mahan Singh spent seventeen years amassing a fortune for his estranged niece by leading mercenary missions all over the world for Leviathon Securities. A decorated soldier in the Indian army, Mahan was discharged after thirteen years of service for disobeying orders while on assignment for the United Nations. Shortly afterward, he joined Leviathon and found himself on a series of strange assignments that involved securing haunted locations and procuring strange artifacts of an occult nature. Locations and artifacts that seemed worthless but were of grave importance to governments and organizations for some reason or another. Mahan didn't know what to make of it. To him, it all felt like a kind of invisible war between secret societies that were somehow able to use governments and corporations like pieces on a chessboard for a bunch of old, moldy books and geometric trinkets from forgotten civilizations.<br><br>Now Mahan was pinned behind a crumbling wall in a village in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya with his fallen unit scattered in pieces all over the surrounding dirt roads. He had been fighting all day against different units and was fresh out of luck and ammunition.<br><br>There’s no way out of here, he told himself. I’ve got no support, no ammunition, no luck. Why do you need luck when you have a weapon and your wits? You’ve been in worse situations and survived. Think you are beaten and you are beaten. I am beaten. You are almost beaten, and that’s not the same thing.<br><br>Suddenly, Mahan heard the surrounding mercenaries yelling at one another in Russian. They were planning an attack and coordinating with one another. He peeked around the corner, then ducked fast as several rounds punched holes into the wall sending clouds of dust and stone into the air. He cursed in Punjabi, grabbed his automatic rifle, then craned his head ever so slightly to see fast-moving silhouettes against the full moon closing in on his position. Quickly, he crawled into a nearby home and hid the asset—the ancient scroll—underneath several corpses of British agents he had killed just before the Russians had decided to join their party. Then he hid in the shadows, holding his rifle by the barrel, refusing to die without a fight.<br><br>They probably all work for The Collector, he told himself. Crazy rich man with too much time and money on his hands. Shah just wants to make sure he gets the scroll before another eccentric billionaire beats him to it. And from where does this prize come? It supposedly comes from a lost, elder civilization with advanced and forbidden knowledge. Nonsense, all of it. A bunch of ancient stories about pagan priests and barbaric rituals and cosmic deities told around a campfire. Ancient sci-fi, at best.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Mahan heard their almost inaudible footfalls before he saw them. His eyes narrowed and his face hardened as two mercs entered the moonlit doorway. With a groan, he launched himself into the air, smashing the butt of his rifle against one head and then the other.<br><br>Both mercs collapsed to the ground unconscious. A split-second later, Mahan yanked a loaded rifle from the hands of one of the fallen mercs and rushed through the doorway taking cover behind a well spilling over with thick buzzing flies like living black soup. Inside the well were the rotting bodies of those who had sought the scroll but had found death instead.<br><br>Mahan buried his nose in his arm and suppressed an instinct to retch. Then, seeing a merc, he lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. Bullets tore holes through the neck and face as the mercenary staggered back and forth, then fell against a wagon with the pulpy head hanging by a shred of flesh.<br><br>As he searched the shadows for other mercs, Mahan suddenly heard the crunch of stone behind him. He whirled to fire—<br><br>A second too late.<br><br>Several rounds pounded into his Kevlar vest like a jackhammer, sending him stumbling backward into the black soup of death. A moment later the surviving mercs loomed over the mouth of the well as a thick black fog coiled around them like a snake.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Mahan closed his eyes and waited for a death that never came. Instead of a report ripping though the darkness like a clap of thunder, he heard a scream followed by a cry and then shrieks of agony. When he opened his eyes, the mercs were gone as though they had been erased by the fog.<br><br>Mahan struggled through the putrid blood and fluids to climb up and out of the well. As he pulled himself over the gore-covered mouth he noticed the world had been plunged into an abyss of fog. Before he could make any sense of what was happening, something snatched his ankle—hard—and tried to pull him back down.<br><br>Desperately, Mahan gripped the edge of the well and held on tightly. He looked to his feet where he saw multiple hands yanking and clutching at his legs. He held on for dear life but his hands slipped in the blood and gore and soon gave way. With a terrible cry, he fell back into the gore as boney hands clawed at his legs, his arms, his throat, his beard, his nose, his turban and pulled him deeper and deeper into the darkness.<br><br>Needless of pain burst inside his head as he drowned in thick, fermenting blood. He knew with a strange resignation that he was dying, or that he was already dead, and that he would never know his niece or what had become of her. After his wife and parents had died in a plane crash and his brother had disappeared, she was the only one left. She was his only family, and he swore he would always take care of her.<br><br>But then life happened, and in the end, he had only taken care of himself. He had lived a lonely, selfish life counter to his upbringing and his beliefs. He was a walking contradiction who had somehow convinced himself that he was cursed, that everyone he had ever loved died or disappeared, and that he was doing his niece a favor by staying out of her life. He had somehow convinced himself that he was keeping his bad luck away from her while he amassed a fortune that he would one day leave her.<br><br>But Mahan knew it was all a lie. He didn’t know the first thing about nurturing and raising a human being. Raising his brother’s daughter terrified him and that’s why he had clung to any reason he could to abandon her. All he knew was killing and destroying in the name of governments and corporations. And as the darkness swallowed him whole, Mahan realized in horror that killing and destroying was all he would ever know.<br><br>Mahan had failed his ancestors. He had failed his family. He had failed his brother and his niece. He would never know her hopes, her dreams, her likes, or dislikes… He would know nothing except the inky blackness that swept over his eyes and the unnamable terrors that awaited him in the great unknown.<br><br><br><br>MAHAN OPENED HIS EYES WITH A START. He was still in the well, submerged in the putrid, death stew, staring up at thick black fog drifting over him as he heard a whirring sound—the sound of a motor accelerating and decelerating somewhere in the distance. He took a moment to gather his senses. He didn’t remember much. He remembered being shot, stumbling back and falling into the well. Everything after that moment felt like a nightmare that had been inspired by one of his father’s stories—the one where unarmed, peaceful protestors were shot dead and stuffed into a well and left to rot in the blistering Punjab heat.<br><br>With a painful groan, Mahan reached out with trembling hands to a jutting rock and, with difficulty, pulled himself free from the gore. Rock by rock, he climbed his way up the festering throat of the well and finally pulled himself over the mouth and into the thick black fog.<br><br>A cry sounded over the incessant whir of the machine and Mahan quickly realized he wasn’t in Kenya anymore. He stood and took in his surroundings. There were strange structures like factories submerged in the fog. Scattered around the structures were piles of clothes and bodies set ablaze. Above in the pale red sky crows circled and cawed adding to the oppressive cacophony.<br><br>“Help… please…”<br><br>Mahan heard a woman crying for help coming from a bank of fog. Snapping out of his daze, he extended his hands and waved a tunnel through the fog, searching for the source of the sound.<br><br>“Help… someone… please… ”<br><br>The disembodied voice reached him again, and she somehow seemed close and far at the same time. He froze to listen carefully, but all he could hear was the incessant whirring of the motor accelerating and decelerating.<br><br>“Help…”<br><br>There it was again. He moved left, then right, and finally he reached a woman in pilot fatigues stuck in a trap of twisted barbed wire. Without a word, he pulled the metal thorns out of her legs as she winced and squirmed in pain with every movement. “I don’t know what happened or how I ended up here…” Her voice trailed away, and she seemed bewildered.<br><br>“What’s the last thing you remember?” Mahan asked as he struggled with the barbed wire.<br><br>The pilot stumbled back and answered with intermittent groans as she nursed her wounds. “I was on patrol… soaring through clear blue skies… when this black cloud suddenly appeared… and then the plane began to shake and break apart and… I don’t know… I was here…”<br><br>A sudden click and they both turned wide-eyed to face the barrel of a rifle. Behind the rifle a man in black fatigues appraised them. “Who the fuck are you two?”<br><br>Mahan raised a hand. “Wait! Careful… we’re not a threat. We’re just as confused as you.”<br><br>“Who are you and what are you doing in Texas? Are you CIA? Is this some kind of a test?”<br><br>Mahan gritted his teeth. “This ain’t a test. And I’m pretty sure this ain’t Texas.”<br><br>“Who are you?!”<br><br>The agent shoved his rifle in Mahan’s face. But before Mahan could answer a Japanese woman in a black and red kimono emerged from the fog, unsheathing a katana with a high-pitched ring. She yelled at them in Japanese, and Mahan extended a calming hand to her. “Please… put the sword down…” He then turned to the agent. “Please… put the gun down… let’s figure this out. “<br><br>“Who are you!” the agent yelled, pushing the muzzle in Mahan’s face. “I won’t ask again!”<br><br>“I can tell you who I am, but that’s not the question, is it?”<br><br>“Yeah! What’s the question, then?”<br><br>“Where?” Mahan said flatly, motioning to the destroyed factories, the craters and the smoldering piles of trash and bodies. “I should think the question is: Where? Where are we?”<br><br>Another voice came from behind. “He’s right, you know. “<br><br>Mahan turned to watch a man with a police jacket emerge from the fog. “We’re still trying to figure that one out… but right now we should all be asking: How?”<br><br>“How?” Mahan repeated.<br><br>“Yes,” the detective said. “How much time do we have before The Horror finds—”<br><br>Before he could finish his sentence, a shriek followed by and high-pitched whine startled them. A moment later a mass of melded humanity and machine came at them.<br><br>Mahan could make out several heads all shrieking battle cries in different languages attached to a patchwork of charred scraps from missiles, tanks, fighter jets, and nuclear submarines all bearing flags and strange logos of brands from different periods he vaguely remembered. He stared at this monstrous chimera in shock and wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at.<br><br>The Horror, he called it. Looks more like the embodiment of war—sponsored war.<br><br>Mahan swallowed a thickness growing in his throat as The Horror rushed the stunned agent and tore his head off, swallowing the terrified face and dripping neck like a ripe cherry. Then its ghastly mouth opened wide and a stream of fire torched the jerking, headless corpse as it collapsed into a heap of industrial garbage.<br><br>Not waiting to be next, the samurai lunged at the monstrosity and, with incredible speed and precision, cut it to pieces. Then all of them watched in disbelief as the pieces of flesh and metal slowly disintegrated into the living fog.<br><br>The detective sighed. “It will be back,” he said, appraising the samurai. “18th or 19th Century. Red Crown Clan. You’re not the first. We could definitely use your skills here.”<br><br>The samurai sheathed her katana and grasped at the fog as though trying to capture pieces of it to study—as though she recognized it.<br><br>Mahan approached the detective. “Where exactly is here?”<br><br>But the detective didn’t answer. He merely turned his back on them and walked away, saying, “Follow me… if you want to escape.”<br><br>Mahan took in a deep breath and gathered his senses. Then he took to his heels and followed the detective into the unknown with the samurai and the fighter pilot in tow.<br><br><br><br>MAHAN FOLLOWED THE DETECTIVE through a labyrinth of bombed-out factories and mountains of garbage set ablaze. At the center of this industrial hell was a giant machine with hooks and cameras and television screens of every possible brand and size broadcasting moments of Mahan’s life as though his brain was a Wi-Fi signal that could stream his memories—his darkest memories. And not just his memories, but the memories of the samurai, the pilot, and the detective. It was as though they had been selected by some unnamable and incompressible intelligence for mere entertainment.<br><br>The detective stopped when he reached what seemed to be a submarine hatch surrounded by a pile of smoldering trash and mangled, charred bodies.<br><br>“Get in!” he yelled, opening the hatch. “I'll explain what I know when we’re safe.”<br><br>“Where does it lead?” Mahan asked.<br><br>“Away from here,” the detective said. “And that’s all you should care about right now. We don’t have time for explanations. But when we’re safe, Ben will answer all your questions as best he can. Right now, you need to—”<br><br>A clanking noise suddenly interrupted him.<br><br>“Go, go, go!” The detective yelled as The Horror came at them from the shadows. Instantly, he pulled out his flashlight, distracting The Horror as Mahan and the others escaped down the hatch."
Arcus 34,Tome10_03,"There are countless horror stories about mist or fog in the chamber, and not all of them are related to The Entity. The Unknowns have done an adequate job at separating the relevant from the irrelevant stories, making my research on what others have written about this place and experience easier to conduct. What is it about the fog—and not just black fog—that has inspired so many stories throughout the omniverse"
Chamber of Blood. Twelve to Midnight. Dark Age to Come.,Tome10_03,"The sound of a bottle clanging against the ground greeted Haddie as she entered the half-burned building that had gone up in flames nearly a week ago. Thick, smoky air stung her nose as she stepped over shards of glass and heaps of charred wood. Bright city lights spilled through the shattered windows and crumbling walls. Carefully, Haddie picked her way across the floor toward the elevator, where she found the door leading to the stairs. A sign on the door warned her that the entire structure would be demolished in the morning.<br><br>There’s still time, she thought, as she ascended the narrow stairs. I’ve got a few hours to convince Max that he’s not crazy, that he’s not losing his grip on reality and that something is happening to our world. Something only a few of us can see and feel.<br><br>Haddie reached the last door at the top of the stairs and pushed her way onto the roof. There she spotted a man sitting on the ledge with thick, tangled hair and a weathered army jacket, drinking himself to oblivion as he stared out at the bright lights of the city.<br><br>She approached him slowly, and he didn’t react or even turn to regard her when she sat down beside him. She merely sat in silence, listening to the police sirens wail in the distance over the horns and the muffled music coming from the clubs and bars below. At last, she said, “I thought I’d find you here.”<br><br>Max took a few swallows of rum. “I don’t know you.”<br><br>“But I know you, Maxwell.”<br><br>“I don’t care where you’re from. I don’t want to talk.”<br><br>“Yes, I can see that. You want to drink.”<br><br>“Perceptive,” he said sarcastically, then extended the bottle toward her. “You’re welcome to join.”<br><br>“No, thank you, Mr. Holt.”<br><br>“How do you know my name?”<br><br>“I know much more about you, Max.”<br><br>“You CIA? FBI?”<br><br>“If I were, you’d already be dead,” Haddie said. “You were an Olympic Biathlon athlete. You were a soldier. Iraq. Syria. Afghanistan. You left the military after an incident and after that you kind of pulled yourself off the grid.”<br><br>“You know how to use a search engine. You get a gold medal. Now leave me alone to my quiet time.” Max raised the bottle and took another swig.<br><br>Haddie narrowed her eyes and looked to the shadows on the roof beyond him. She couldn’t see anything but she could hear disembodied voices talking to him. She shut them out, then leaned closer to him. “I know you see and hear things others can’t. I know they follow you. I know you want them to stop. And I didn’t get all that from a search engine.”<br><br>Max lowered the bottle from his lips and fixed his gaze on a couple arguing on the sidewalk below. “You don’t know what I hear… what I see…”<br><br>“Things from another place. Another world. Another realm.”<br><br>Max swallowed a growing lump in his throat.<br><br>Haddie paused, then continued:<br><br>“Something otherworldly attacked your unit and you survived because of your abilities and now… no one believes a word of it. You were ridiculed, discharged and silenced with an endless supply of opioids to fog your memory and neutralize your questions.”<br><br>Haddie stopped as his eyes filled with tears.<br><br>“You’re not crazy, Max. You saw what you saw, and no drug or drink in the world will relieve the guilt or stop the nightmares. And that’s why you’re here, isn’t it… Waiting for morning to make it all stop.”<br><br>Max cleared his throat. “What do you want?”<br><br>“Your skills and abilities on my team.”<br><br>“And what team is that?”<br><br>“The one that is trying to stop the end of the world.”<br><br>Max laughed uproariously, then stopped at once. “You’re serious?”<br><br>Haddie grabbed the bottle out of his hands, took a swig, handed it back to him and nodded gravely.<br><br>Max shook his head. “What do you know about what happened to my unit?”<br><br>“Not much,” Haddie admitted. “What I do know is there are some very powerful people who have the answers or think they have the answers you’re looking for. What I do know is that since I was a teen I’ve been caught in the crossfire between two warring groups that need people like us to access this other realm and bring things back. I’ve been running from them for the last forty years, and I have helped others like us from suffering an unknown fate at their cruel hands.”<br><br>Max’s face hardened. “They laughed at me. They said something in me snapped and that I had imagined the fog and the creatures that came out of it.”<br><br>Haddie shook her head. “You didn’t imagine anything. I lost my brother in the same way.”<br><br>They exchanged a look.<br><br>“He’s not dead… I can still hear him… I do… but I can’t see him…”<br><br>“Where is he?”<br><br>Haddied shrugged. “I don’t know. All I know is we’re not the only ones who lost friends and loved ones to this phenomenon. And if we work together we might one day see them again.”<br><br>Max laughed and pulled on his bottle. “So you’re recruiting me? Is that what you’re doing? Recruiting me in some kind of paranormal army.” He laughed, again in disbelief.<br><br>Haddie watched him laugh. “I’m giving you what you need.”<br><br>“And what is that?”<br><br>“A second chance,” Haddie answered flatly. “Purpose. Meaning. A chance to save others from being murdered or used by the same assholes who are coming for you right now as we speak.”<br><br>Max laughed. “What are you talking about? Who’s coming for me?”<br><br>“I have a list—”<br><br>Haddie broke off abruptly. She pulled out a gun from her jacket and shot two dim figures in the head as they emerged from the exit door. She then jerked to her feet and hurried to the bodies, searching their jackets for IDs without any success. “They’ll be more,” she said, looking up at Max as he stepped beside her with wide, confused eyes. “You’re at the top of their list and that’s why I’m here.”<br><br>“What list? What are you talking about?”<br><br>“Follow me,” Haddie said. “And I’ll explain everything.”<br><br>Max nodded, dropped his bottle with a loud clang, and followed Haddie down the stairs, through the charred building, and out into the ally where a cab was waiting for them.<br><br><br><br>MAX HOLT STOOD IN THE BASEMENT of the Park & Sherwood bookstore examining a wall of pictures, notes and numbers covered by a web of red string highlighting connections. He narrowed his gaze on hundreds if not thousands of missing people from all over the world. Tacked between the pictures and notes were transcripts of horror stories from various podcasts decoded into numbers and coordinates. He then glanced around the room and noticed artifacts and artwork from ancient civilizations he did not recognize from any history book he had ever read, and he had read many. He turned back to the wall and noticed for the first time a picture of his unit in Afghanistan among countless other units that were missing in action. His face grew stern, his eyes narrowed, and he turned to Haddie and asked, “Is this the list?”<br><br>Haddie stepped beside him. “This is the list of those we failed.” Her eyes fixed on a picture of her brother at a World War Two zeppelin crash site in the French Alps where they had recovered several “Wunder Weapons” that a secret unit of German soldiers was transporting for the Thule Society. It was the last time she had seen him before he had disappeared. “The list is of those that are being targeted by some very powerful and disturbed elites. They will either be killed in ritual sacrifice, or they will be used as tools to search areas that overlap with another dimension.”<br><br>“I don’t understand.”<br><br>“I know it’s a lot to take in. But these groups… they communicate through random podcasts and deliver encoded messages in stories and media. And we do our best to decode them.”<br><br>Max scoffed. “Is this some kind of joke? Codes in stories… That’s your list?”<br><br>Haddie shook her head. “This is real. There are people who are in serious danger, and you can help them. You left the government because they laughed and ridiculed you. That won’t happen with us. We know what you saw is real.”<br><br>Max approached the picture of his unit.<br><br>“I’ve got names and places and endless funds at my disposal,” she said. “We’re twelve to midnight, and only a few of us know it, and I need you on our team, not theirs.”<br><br>“Minutes?”<br><br>“Seconds. Twelve seconds.”<br><br>“These groups,” Max queried. “Are they that powerful?”<br><br>“You have no idea.”<br><br>Max extended his hand, touching the picture of his unit. He then followed a red string to a passage culled from a horror story. From the passage, he followed yet another string to a series of numbers—the time, day and place the creatures in the fog attacked them.<br><br>Haddie stepped away and soon returned with a folder, pulling out a picture of an abandoned cemetery in Chile along with a picture of a man. She handed the pictures to Max, and he stared at them for a long, thoughtful moment before nodding that he would join her team."
Chamber of Blood. Rabbits Attack Hiker in Colorado.,Tome10_03,"A hiker is in critical condition after being bitten by a dozen rabbits that escaped the Acendix Research Institute, an emergency responder said Friday. The hiker was bitten in the legs and face near Misty Lake, said national park ranger Steve Downer. The hiker’s condition was unknown Friday but doctors are optimistic."
Chamber of Blood. The Redcrane. Veil of Blood. 1.,Tome10_03,"Several paths lead to the harbor where peasants and merchants had witnessed the strange arrival of a foreign ship. They discussed the ship and the arrival in the surrounding villages with mingled anger, fear and curiosity. Most believed the foreigners were here to disseminate contraband and rob their beloved land of precious artifacts. Many believed a band of thieves was selling these precious goods to these foreigners in exchange for their weapons. Some even claimed that they had seen these thieves on the gangway, loading stolen artifacts and relics from fallen lords and noble families onto their ship.<br><br>Saku Nakano stood in the moonlight, considering her options. There was the long and safe route along the dirt road, and there were shorter routes through the dark and deadly woods where many unlucky villagers had been killed by creatures—it was said—not of this world.<br><br>Saku knew of these cursed places all too well. She had lost her entire clan to these mist-enshrouded areas over the years and now she roamed the country—the last of The Red Crown Clan—seeking out the great corruption that was upon her people, finishing what her clan had started centuries ago.<br><br>The enemies to her clan, The Black Serpent Society, served a nine-headed serpent made of black mist. They believed the black serpent would grant them powers and boons beyond human comprehension in this world and the next in exchange for unquestioning devotion. They were convinced that the black-mist serpent was a demon that slithered through these wooded cursed areas creating doorways into what they called The Belly of the Serpent, or just, The Belly.<br><br>Saku turned toward the dark woods, and sensing raw evil in her midst, she prepared to enter, thinking about the hushed conversations she had overheard in the nearby markets. She remembered the merchant hacking and gutting fish as he talked to a woman who was going through a bag of oysters she had just gathered in the sea. She remembered them talking about how they had seen bandits with pistols and gunpowder and other strange weapons.<br><br>I remember them mentioning the foreigners, she thought. They said they were Dutchmen. They were on the wharf speaking fluent Japanese with unknown merchants in plain kimonos with the exception of a strange serpent crest. They described the crest as a nine-headed serpent twisted in a circular knot as it chased its nine tails. They described only a few sailors and how most of the crew had perished of an unnamed disease during the voyage across the ocean.<br><br>A sudden laugh interrupted her thoughts.<br><br>“Where is your husband? “<br><br>A man in a plain brown kimono looked her up and down in the pearly light of the moon as he approached her.<br><br>Saku met his gaze but did not react or respond.<br><br>The man placed his hand lightly on the hilt of his sword as he continued to appraise her. She was tall and lean with strong, sinuous arms and piercing dark eyes. She had long, black oiled hair gathered in a perfect queue, doubled over and tied neatly with a red and white sash. She wore thong sandals and a simple black kimono. A vibrant red sash around her waist held two scabbard swords. One sword was short and straight, the other was long and curved at the tip.<br><br>“Where are your papers?”<br><br>The man edged closer to her with dim recognition in his eyes. He had heard rumors of an Onna-Musha in a black and red kimono roaming the land, destroying the wicked while protecting those who could not protect themselves. Or did she roam the land seeking justice for her butchered clan? Or was she a bandit leader who raided and pillaged villages?<br><br>The man couldn’t quite remember what he had heard, and he had forgotten the name people had given her. It was related to her clan and its origin. That much he knew, but not much more. It would have helped if he had paid closer attention when his wife had been discussing her many adventures with her sisters.<br><br>But he had ignored most of the stories as exaggerated gossip and legends not unlike that other samurai that everyone called a demon. There was no such thing as a demon samurai and there was certainly no such thing as a woman samurai that could perform all the feats the stories claimed she had performed.<br><br>Saku breathed deeply and placed her hand near the hilt of her long sword.<br><br>“Do you not see I am addressing you! Where are your papers! Answer me wo—”<br><br>With impossible speed, Saku whirled her sword in a gleaming silver arc and the man’s torso toppled off his hips and a fountain of warm crimson fed the ground. The twisted mouth twitched as it sputtered bile and blood and tried to make out the words, “Redcrane.”<br><br>He had remembered—<br><br>A moment too late.<br><br>Returning her sword to its scabbard, Saku sighed and said an inward prayer for the brute. Then she stepped over his jerking torso and entered The Belly of the Serpent.<br><br><br><br>WITH CAREFUL, SILENT STEPS, Saku pushed smoothly through The Belly, paying close attention to the lurking black mist slithering through gnarled trees that seemed to shift and waver with her every step, as though to intimidate her.<br><br>Don’t make a sound, she thought, stepping down a slope through noiseless shadows toward the sound of waves crashing against rocks. She was close to the wharf. She could smell the seaweed, fish and salt in the air.<br><br>There was also something else.<br><br>A strange heaviness in the atmosphere.<br><br>Staring up through the shaking canopy, she saw thick clouds marching across the sky. She sensed the floor moving, and looked down to see her legs completely submerged in the creeping mist. A moment later a branch cracked not ten paces away, and she knew she wasn’t alone anymore.<br><br>Saku neither ran nor hid. She froze, closed her eyes, listening carefully for threats approaching through the black mist that heaved and moved as though it were alive.<br><br>Saku knew she was somehow—as difficult as it was to explain—in two worlds at once. And she knew there were demons and monsters in the other world that hunted within these overlapping areas.<br><br>Saku didn’t know much about this other world. What she knew she had learned from her mother and father. The Black Serpent Society—they had once explained—believed the black-mist serpent was a living deity that consumed people, towns, civilizations and worlds.<br><br>The Black Serpent Society believed that within The Belly there was lost knowledge and power from all these consumed worlds that could help them usher in a golden age of peace, prosperity and abundance. Their dedication, their devotion, their ritualistic killings were, in the end, for the betterment of humanity.<br><br>The Red Crown Clan, however, believed the promise of a golden age was nothing more than a cosmic ruse—a shiny gold lure to snag minnows, fish and whales in the abyss.<br><br>With a deep breath, Saku sensed the threats were gone. She opened her eyes and continued through wavering light and shadow as the wind began to pick-up and the mist grew thicker. But then she stopped suddenly when she heard a familiar roar.<br><br>A thunderous roar that seem to shake the world.<br><br>This time she didn’t close her eyes.<br><br>She didn’t run.<br><br>This time she silently lowered herself by a tree as she heard the pounding footfalls of a giant samurai in shiny green and gold armor approaching. She heard him smashing bushes and trees with his kanabo as he searched for her in the shadows. She knew without seeing him that she was being hunted by the samurai that had been corrupted and turned into a demon by the Black Mist Serpent.<br><br>Her sister had told her many tales about this samurai. How he had once been a man of honor and conviction. How he had hunted and executed corrupt merchants and false samurai. How peasants and villagers began calling him a demon because of his savage methods. And how he had ultimately been turned into the very thing he hated most, the very thing the stories depicted him as—<br><br>The Oni Samurai.<br><br>The very same Oni her sister savagely battled long ago when they had been caught in the mist. She had escaped, her sister hadn’t and now all she wanted to do was take down this demon and make him tell her where she was.<br><br>But Saku knew better than to lose herself in the past. She pushed the memory of her sister out of her thoughts and instantly found her focus. She looked through a gap in the trees toward the wharf, where she saw orange specs of light against the wall of darkness that was the sea. She could make it. She could outrun him to a place where he could not follow.<br><br>Looking over her shoulder, Saku saw the giant samurai only ten paces away. He was decked in shiny gold and green armor, and carried around his back a massive leather bag dripping, thick blood at the bottom. A few heads jutted out of the bag and clouds of buzzing flies surrounded him.<br><br>The Oni searched the trees and bramble and was now only seven paces away. Unexpectedly, something jerked away from a bush and he launched at the creature and smashed it with his kanabo, losing his bag in the attack. The bag fell and dozens of heads rolled toward her.<br><br>One head stopped at her feet and stared at her with wide open eyes.<br><br>Saku gasped as she suddenly realized she was staring at her own face. She fixed her gaze at the other heads in the mist and thought that they all seemed to resemble her, as though this demon samurai had already decapitated her countless times before.<br><br>None of it made sense.<br><br>Impossible, she thought. It cannot be. And yet… it is… Have I fallen to the demon before? Are there others like me in the demon world that made him? But look… a scar!<br><br>Saku observed the head at her feet and noticed a long scar on the side of her face. She instinctively felt her own cheek where the scar should have been. It was proof that this was someone else, though she could not deny the resemblance was uncanny.<br><br>Saku swatted flies and reached for the head to get a closer look, but then she suddenly froze when she heard a terrifying roar not five paces behind her. In one fluid motion she dove into a thicket as the kanabo missed its mark. Without a moment to spare, she scrambled to her feet and turned just in time to see a gore-covered kanabo with the crushed head of a rabbit coming down on her with devastating speed.<br><br>Quickly, she sidestepped and withdrew her sword. An instant later she slashed off the demon’s arm with a roar of her own. But knowing the arm would grow back in the mist, she turned and charged away, desperately running for the beach. She had downed the demon before, but somehow it always managed to rise unscathed to continue the hunt.<br><br>There was no defeating the demon.<br><br>There was only one option: escape.<br><br>As she rushed through the woods, she turned back to see the demon chasing after her. She pushed herself to run faster and faster, and just as the demon lunged at her again, she dove out of the mist through a break in the trees to a place he could not follow.<br><br>The demon samurai stopped suddenly and watched her closely.<br><br>Saku clambered to her feet, brushing off sand, seaweed and salt. She turned to face the edge of the woods where she saw red glowing eyes fade into the night. Then she heard the crunch of rocks behind her followed by a clicking sound. She turned slowly to face the barrel of a musket pistol glinting in the moonlight."
Chamber of Blood. The Redcrane. Veil of Blood. 2.,Tome10_03,"SAKU LOOKED BEYOND THE PISTOL to a man in a dark kimono and short black hair. He inched closer to her with a smile, but she did not move nor give him the satisfaction of flinching. She met his gaze and edged back slightly. Then she stared off in the distance where she could see shadows moving about a cluster of abandoned homes near the wharf. The small village had been abandoned, no doubt, due to its proximity to the woods and the creatures that lurked within the mist.<br><br>The man cleared his throat and placed the barrel inches from her face.<br><br>Saku stared into his eyes without fear or concern. She looked down at his sandals and back to his eyes. “Move!” he ordered, his ignorant smile widening. “I know who—”<br><br>A sudden flash of moonlight and his head toppled off his shoulders before he could finish his sentence.<br><br>Saku watched the headless body spray warm blood into the cool night as it jerked left and right and finally collapsed into a mound of shells and seaweed, startling a nervous crab that instantly scuttled away into the gloom of night.<br><br>Saku gripped her sword and patiently picked her way through the jagged rock formations to reach the small village where Black Serpent brutes guarded the area against anyone who might try to interfere with their dark rituals and secret trade negotiations.<br><br>She moved silently through the shadows, following the edge of a home. She froze when she heard footsteps approaching. She slowly placed her back against the wall and waited. She peeked around the corner and saw two thugs telling stories about the demon samurai.<br><br>She crouched slightly, then, like a mighty tigress, she leaped into the air and thrust her sword through the two heads. They jerked violently then collapsed when she pulled her sword from their skulls.<br><br>She took a moment to survey the area, then made her way noiselessly to the wharf where three thugs laughed and made jokes about the strange red alcohol the foreigners had shared with them.<br><br>She held her sword firm, and she started toward them, practically gliding with quick, smooth steps. Just as one brute turned to meet her focused gaze she lunged with blinding speed and—<br><br>Three headless bodies suddenly staggered stupidly in the dark and collapsed into each other with arterial blood spraying darkness against the bright light of the moon.<br><br>Wiping warm blood off her face, she climbed a series of crates, moved past a clump of fishing nets, and crouched by the gangplank. She listened carefully for movement and heard steps just above in the ship.<br><br>When the footsteps receded to silence, she moved stealthily up the gangplank and halted, scanning the ship, spotting one thug sitting crossed-legged on a crate. Beside him were several other crates bearing the VOC logo and name of the Dutch East India Company.<br><br>Carefully, Saku embarked on the ship and moved toward the brute. But just as she prepared to pounce, she heard a click, followed by a high-pitched wheeling sound. It took her less than a moment to understand she had been lured into a trap—less than a moment too late.<br><br>Before Saku had time to react, she felt the heaviness of a net collapse over her as dozens of thugs surrounded her with dirty looks and curses. She then watched the sitting thug, the leader of the group, turn to face her.<br><br>The leader smiled, stood briskly, and laughed. “We thought you might show up?” he said as he approached her. He made a quick wave with his hand, and the thugs instantly trained musket pistols on her. “You’ve been quite busy interfering with our good work.”<br><br>She didn’t respond, but she pushed and pulled against the net to gauge its strength. She glared at him as she realized this was no chance ambush. The Black Serpent Society had been tracking her and had somehow managed to trap her. The leader shook his head at her.<br><br>“Your clan is destroyed. Your weapon is irrelevant and outdated. You’re outnumbered and trapped and still you think you can do the impossible.”<br><br>This will be difficult, she thought. But not impossible. I’ve been in worse situations and survived.<br><br>Saku inched closer to the leader as he smiled at her. She believed his reluctance to shoot her was evidence that they wanted her alive for one of their rituals.<br><br>The leader motioned to all the thugs and laughed, again.<br><br>Saku gritted her teeth and studied the thugs as they slowly closed in on her from every direction. She looked into the leader’s thieving dark eyes and saw all the lies and treachery of the Black Serpent Society. Then, looking beyond his eyes, she visualized herself triumphing against her enemy, leaping from thug to thug, cutting them down with her sword like weeds.<br><br>Suddenly, the leader barked orders, snapping her back to reality. The thugs inched closer to her with hideous smiles and wide, nervous eyes.<br><br>“Surrender willingly,” the leader said flatly. “And we will reunite you with your clan—as misguided as they may have been.”<br><br>Saku understood his meaning.<br><br>He believed their rituals would open a doorway into the nameless realm where they were supposedly trapped and cursed to live out an endless cycle of life and death for reasons beyond comprehension.<br><br>Saku didn’t know what to believe. What she did know was that she wouldn’t allow these thugs the satisfaction of serving her on a sacrificial platter to the darkness they served and she had promised to destroy. She had made an oath long ago as a member of the Red Crown Clan to cleanse the world of the reeking corruption that was the Black Serpent Society, and she planned to honor that oath.<br><br>With the strength and power of her ancestors coursing through her veins, Saku instantly rushed forward, her hand thrusting through the net. Powerful fingers grabbed the leader by the scruff of his kimono and pulled him in. Then, using him as a human shield, she whirled as pistols fired and balls ripped through his belly, chest and skull.<br><br>Through the rising smoke from the pistols, Saku could see the thugs trying to reload. Without a moment to lose, she tossed her busted and shredded shield to the ground, and, with difficulty, she sliced through the net with her sword. A moment later, she was a hurricane of death and destruction, leaping from thug to thug as her hissing blade painted the deck red.<br><br>The thugs didn’t know what to do. They were too stunned to react. It was like fighting a ghost, a monstrous shadow, a formless mist with swords for claws. Their futile attempts to parry her attacks with pistols met empty air as limbs fell and heads rolled.<br><br>It was a horrible nightmare, as if by some strange, ironic twist of fate the Redcrane actually drew her power from the black mist serpent so that she was somehow a servant of the very darkness she had sworn to eliminate.<br><br>When the last thug fell with a gasp, Saku found herself surrounded by blood and carnage. She took in the stench of gunpowder as her gaze slowly lowered to a thug groveling like a maggot. She had sliced his legs at the knees and he was crawling away with nervous elbows that slipped with every move in the growing pool of blood.<br><br>Wiping the gore off her face and kimono, she blocked his path and crouched to face him. The thug looked up at her with widening eyes. A bleat of terror rose from his throat that rose to a shrill pitch as she raised her sword and ended his service to the Black Serpent Society.<br><br>Saku rose slowly, and searching the ship, spotted a cluster of oil lamps glowing and flickering atop a crate. With focused determination, she picked her way through the bodies and kicked the crate, sending the oil lamps scattering to the wooden deck below.<br><br>The lamps spat liquid fire and set the deck and lifeboat ablaze. Then, walking away from the burning ship, Saku considered everything she had just experienced.<br><br>Trapped. How did they know she was coming for them? How could she have taken the bait? How had she been lured so easily?<br><br>Enough. Warriors do not waste time with what ifs and what they should have or could have done. What matters now is the present and taking the next right step.<br><br>Where to now?<br><br>She couldn’t think straight.<br><br>Despite all her training, a flame of anger burst in Saku for her careless mistake. Yet, she repressed her frustration and knew there was no use for it. Anger would only cloud her judgment and waste her time. She needed to keep her composure because—<br><br>Her friends and family could not have perished in vain. Because she was the last of her clan. Because the Black Serpent Society had to be stopped. Because she the hope of all those who believed she would end the darkness that was upon their land. Because she was—<br><br>The Redcrane."
Arcus 41,Tome10_03,"The Mad Designer sketches are preposterous yet entertaining. I just went through hundreds of sketches of monsters and killers in tuxedos and golfing attire. Makes no sense, and yet I found myself pinning these absurd illustrations in my study. They have absolutely no value to my investigation, yet they made me smile, even laugh, and, perhaps that’s enough. Perhaps helping me forget the horrors of this place even for just a moment turns the absurdity of these designs into a kind of medicine. As much as I take offense to the complete disregard the Mad Designer has for these characters… I can’t help but search the Chamber of Blood for more Emperor Dwight illustrations. They are—so far—my favorite."
Arcus 8542,Tome10_03,"The creatures move around the fog, watching me without attacking. They’re waiting for the perfect moment, which will never come, for I have barricaded every door and window and practice savage and efficient combat maneuvers with my nine iron. I’ve caught glimpses of their forms, and they are ever-changing, as though imitating all the monsters I’ve read about in my favorite stories, as though the fog itself were an extension of my dark imagination and fears. I’m calling these horrible things… Creatures of the Fog."
Arcus 27,Tome10_Observer,"Most of the fiction featuring Haddie and Jordan end with one of the siblings disappearing, which accounts for some of the contradicting memories I’ve discovered in the fog. I believe there are several actual Haddies and Jordans stuck here with all the others. The memories I’ve studied so far conflict with one another so that they rarely line up with each other or the fictional stories I found in the Chamber of Blood. However, I must always remember that the collected stories and artwork in the chamber are interpretative, they are not exact, and they were more or less inspired by several versions of the siblings that exist or will exist or have existed within the endless tapestry that is the omniverse.<br><br>The truth is… The Unknowns have collected so many stories that I don’t know where to begin my research. Currently, I am focusing on The Redcrane and Twelve to Midnight to better understand how the black fog works and how the characters in these stories may have been able to interact with it to their advantage. There are also many versions of Dejavuism that relate a story of how one man found a way into the darkest recesses of this dimension to save the one he loved. But the story doesn’t go into the details of how he managed to find a way in, and I will have to go through other versions of the story to see if there is any information that can help me. Better yet, I am hoping to find his actual memories within the fog to give me a sense of how he found a way into this realm."
Chamber of Blood. Dejavuism.,Tome10_Observer,"It was a book club, and they were arguing over the latest Edwin Cain novel along with the interview the author had given where he discussed a concept he had called Dejavuism. He put forward the theory that our brains are biological, quantum computers with vast networking abilities beyond our current understanding of physics. Cain believed that our quantum brains could connect to other beings with similar frequencies within the multiverse as though they were inter-dimensional cellphones. The club members, who discussed these theories and how they sometimes felt their inner voice was another version of themselves advising them from another time or place, began telling stories about instincts, gut feelings, and deja-vu experiences that felt all too real. There was one skeptic who scoffed at the idea of the multiverse. He thought the idea was ridiculous comic book nonsense, and he laughed at the very notion that our brains were interconnected, multidimensional computers that received or projected ideas from the ether.<br><br>One woman exclaimed:<br><br>“It could be true. Such a theory would help us understand why ideas seem to come to us as a group, or why so many similar ideas seem to bubble up all over the world at pretty much the same time. Who’s to say we aren’t all tapping into the same stream of ideas.”<br><br>The skeptic answered:<br><br>“It’s just coincidence. That’s all it is when a bunch of people from different places come up with similar ideas. And coincidence has nothing to do with the multiverse or other versions of ourselves in the universe.”<br><br>Another man shook his head and said:<br><br>“I don’t really agree. There’s shit out there we just don’t understand, and I recently read the idea for Wi-Fi and cellphones came from a bunch of scientists trying to understand a gland in our brain. A gland that’s bioluminescent and seems to be searching for signals. Granted this could be online misinformation, but what is true, and what many cultures believe is that our artists can tap into things not of this world. What I found interesting was how Cain said these visions that artists receive are only accessible to those who experience trauma when they’re young, those who have been bullied, abused, exiled… those who have learned to shut out their reality for self-protection in order to fully experience other realities.”<br><br>A woman added:<br><br>“The door to the physical world closes, the door to another world opens.”<br><br>The skeptic laughed and was just about to speak when another woman, an aspiring storyteller, interrupted him and said:<br><br>“I get visions and dreams about the same place all the time. One of my recurring dreams is of Romulus and how he is taken up by a massive black storm cloud and brought to this dark realm where he’s chased by a hideous creature… a monster that could not possibly exist. What’s strange is he’s not alone. He’s not the only being hunted. He’s with a biker and two other Scottish men who at first I thought were sailors, but then I had this other dream that showed me that they were, in fact, lighthouse keepers. I did some research and I could swear by the pictures that the biker I was seeing was Yui Kimura, the one who disappeared a few years ago.”<br><br>The skeptic laughed and said:<br><br>“So what your saying is the Emperor of Rome wasn’t assassinated by his generals but is somehow stuck in some kind of demented world with Yuri Kimura and two lighthouse keepers. This, you somehow believe, is real. Romulus and Yui are running from a monster as we sip coffee and tea in our cozy chairs and talk books and authors. This is what you’re putting forward as something possible? Something reasonable for all of us to believe?”<br><br>A woman said:<br><br>“It sounds a bit out there. But maybe there are things in the cosmos that are beyond reason or science.”<br><br>Another woman beamed at the aspiring storyteller and said:<br><br>“Real or not, you should write a story for your blog or even for your next performance. I think it would be a lot of fun, even if it does require a little suspension of disbelief.”<br><br>The aspiring storyteller smiled and answered:<br><br>“Actually, I have a draft I’ve been working on, which I wanted to share with the group before I posted it. I’m still not sure if it’s a story I can perform because it’s a bit complicated and messy, but maybe you can help me find ways to energize and simplify it.”<br><br>Everyone nodded enthusiastically, except for the skeptic who rolled his eyes.<br><br>The storyteller pulled out a coffee stained notebook and opened it to a story that she still hadn’t titled. She took a deep, calming breath and began:<br><br>“This story doesn’t have a title but I’m thinking of calling it The Tragedy of Cliff and Alex, who were real people and who disappeared before most of us were born. Now, I’m not one to believe in conspiracy theories or urban legends but their story, which I acquired through extensive interviews and research opened my mind to the possibility that there is more to our lives than that which can be seen or proven.”<br><br>The skeptic quipped:<br><br>“Well, that’s convenient, isn’t it?”<br><br>The storyteller ignored his comment and continued:<br><br>“Love, for example, exists and ceases to exist just as soon as we indulge in proofs and evidence. As soon as there is doubt… as soon as there is a need for proof… love is dead. And yet, we know love is a real. And we know—don’t we—that love is quite unreasonable. It’s powerful. It’s maddening. And we hate that we can’t define it. Love exists, and it doesn’t need to be proven in any way, shape or form for it to be real—” the storyteller made an exaggerated gesture to grab something in the empty air—”And yet, just as soon as you try to grasp it—it tatters at the touch.<br><br>“Cliff Barra always loved horror movies. He started making scary movies when his father bought him his first Super 8 camera. And so it comes to no surprise that he grew up to be a famous director who translated his favorite gothic novels and horror stories to the silver screen. It’s also no surprise that when he met Alex Damaro, an equally famous art director known for his brilliant and visionary production sets and costume designs, that they were instantly smitten with one another. Together, it`s safe to say, they produced some of the scariest and most iconic films to date. But all this changed when Alex suddenly disappeared while on set in a rolling cloud of black fog the crew insisted they had not designed.<br><br>“From that point on, the movies stopped. A great heaviness came over Cliff as he found himself confronted by the horror that he would never see Alex again. He turned his back on his friends, his career, his life, and he became possessed by an obsession to find out what had happened to Alex. Investigations into this strange fog led him to a group of people searching for missing loved ones. With this group he learned about the existence of secret cults and societies that understood the black fog and the strange realm from which it came. He dug deeper and deeper, discovering his old movie set wasn’t haunted as everyone said it was… but was… a kind of doorway to another realm. So he returned to the haunted movie set where Alex disappeared and waited… and waited… He waited for days until finally he heard Alex’s laughter, and with the laughter came the fog. And the fog rolled in and carried him away.<br><br>“And so, Cliff ended up in another world that defied his wildest nightmares. He followed Alex’s voice through a darkness that had never known the light of day. At last, he came upon a forest of wooden stakes bearing skewered heads. He picked his way through the stakes, inspecting each head. The scene reminded him of one of the first films he had made as a teenager. He soon came to one head that resembled an old producer friend of his. Suddenly, the eyes sprang open, and Cliff started. At once, all the heads came alive, taunting and ridiculing him like he had been ridiculed as a child for his passions and hobbies.<br><br>""But Cliff stayed the course despite the insults and the taunts that he would never see Alex again. One head of the thousands shouted louder than the rest. The head screamed that Alex was being corrupted and that he should turn back before it was too late. Realizing this severed head knew more than the rest, Cliff kicked the stake and caught the head as it toppled off. The head protested and yelled that it had once been a king and it didn’t want to be in the hands of a commoner. And Cliff promised the king he would release him after—and only after—he helped him find Alex.<br><br>“Long story short, the head lead Cliff to the edge of a massive gate that surrounded a town that resembled every production set Alex had ever designed for Cliff. Before he could take in the area, he suddenly heard Alex screaming in the distance. The king warned Cliff not to interfere with the process and explained that Alex was being twisted and tortured into a brutal, murdering monster for reasons they would never understand.<br><br>“But Cliff couldn’t bear to hear Alex suffer. Every agonizing scream was a dagger in his heart. And so, dropping the head, he climbed over the gate and, unperturbed by the formless creatures moving in the fog, he followed the cries to the top of a castle he recognized from his Frankenstein film. Cliff charged up the winding stairs to the roof, where he found Alex agonizing on a metal table as bolts of lightning struck him every few moments from a thick, black storm cloud. All around him in glass prisons filled with formaldehyde were all the monsters Alex had ever designed since he was a child. Cliff couldn’t believe what he wasn’t seeing. It was as if this living nightmare were all a projection of their combined memories.<br><br>“Cliff didn’t even try to understand what was happening or what he was experiencing. Without hesitation, he rushed up to Alex not knowing what to do. In the shadows he spotted an ax on the cobblestone floor and instantly grabbed it. Then, despite the deadly lightning, he pushed through the sizzling and sparking pain to smash the chains that bound Alex to the table. Alex opened his half-conscious eyes with difficulty. He barely recognized Cliff. Alex squinted with charred eyelids and managed to murmur words that made Cliff smile. Then Cliff hefted Alex over his shoulders and charged down the stairs and out into the thickening fog where frantic, formless creatures did all they could to prevent them from escaping.<br><br>“Cliff kicked, punched and charged through the fog, smashing through creatures, crows, and claws—everything and anything the world set against him. He remembered the king telling him something about a hatch—the hatch would somehow lead to freedom. Desperately, Cliff searched the ground as he heard a roar followed by a clap of thunder. Pounding steps chased him through the darkness. He didn’t even bother to look back. He rushed forward until he saw it! The glint of metal by a crumbling Gargoyle statue from one of his movies. He ran to the hatch, opened it, and lowered Alex to safety. Then, just as he was about to descend, something sharp like talons clutched his ankles and pulled him screaming into the raging fog!<br><br>“I’d like to say that it all worked out in the end and that they lived happily ever after. But that’s not the truth of this story. The truth is Cliff took Alex’s place at the torturer’s table and was turned into a perfect champion of horror with little or no memory of who he was or how he ended up in this dark realm. And Alex… well… He ended up with a group of stranded souls who did whatever they could just to survive. But that’s another story for another time. Suffice to say that love torments all—bringing the best and worst out of us when we least expect it.”<br><br>The storyteller finished and everyone was silent and inward, thinking about what they had sacrificed for love and what they would sacrifice for love. But not the skeptic. No, the skeptic was turning the story over and over in his head searching for issues. At last, he broke the silence, asking:<br><br>“What happened to the head? The talking head? Cliff just drops the king’s head and then you never hear about it again. It kind of makes the story incomplete.”<br><br>A woman blurted out:<br><br>“Who cares about the damn head? It’s a love story!”<br><br>The skeptic added:<br><br>“Also, I don’t think you can use 'tatters' as a verb.”<br><br>The storyteller smiled and politely said:<br><br>“I’m still working the story, and the ideas are still coming to me in my dreams. I’ve been logging them in my notebooks and I’ll re-read the current version more critically to see if I need to do something else with the talking head.”<br><br>Another woman said:<br><br>“All that horror, and for what? To end up twisted and tortured and turned into some abomination worse than anything he ever filmed. I feel so bad for him.”<br><br>A man said:<br><br>“I don’t. Not because I don’t like him as a character, but because that’s just the kinda things we do for love—the horrible and the beautiful, the bitter and the sweet, the euphoria and the madness—” he lost himself in a memory for a moment—”Love twists and torments. And I’m sure there’s nothing that dark world can do to anyone that would surpass the torment of not knowing what had happened to a loved one… or worse… the regret of knowing what had happened and not doing anything.”<br><br>Another man said:<br><br>“Well, I do hope you publish this story on your blog. I found it heartbreaking and terrifying… and I guess I’m wondering if you really think this is what happened to the real Cliff and Alex.”<br><br>The storyteller shrugged and closed her notebook as she prepared to leave. She wasn’t sure what she believed anymore.<br><br>The skeptic laughed and said:<br><br>“I’ll tell you what I think. I think the real Cliff and Alex faked their disappearance to get out of the limelight, and they moved far, far away to some gorgeous, exotic island where they’re eating grapes, drinking margaritas, and living happily ever after.”<br><br>The man said:<br><br>“Well, I do hope you’re right and the story is just a story. But if you’re not… well… I hope Alex will one day be able to do for Cliff what Cliff did for him.”<br><br>A woman said:<br><br>“It kind of makes you wonder if the characters we read about in the books are actually real somewhere.”<br><br>Another woman said:<br><br>“A story in this world, reality in another.”<br><br>The storyteller stood, smiled at all the book club members, and excused herself as she had an early shift at the café. Everyone said goodbye, watched her disappear out the door, and then returned to their discussion about Edwin Cain, Dejavuism, and the story they had just heard."
Chamber of Blood. Day of Night. Mahan Singh. 1.,Tome10_Observer,"Mahan Singh spent seventeen years amassing a fortune for his estranged niece by leading mercenary missions all over the world for Leviathon Securities. A decorated soldier in the Indian army, Mahan was discharged after thirteen years of service for disobeying orders while on assignment for the United Nations. Shortly afterward, he joined Leviathon and found himself on a series of strange assignments that involved securing haunted locations and procuring strange artifacts of an occult nature. Locations and artifacts that seemed worthless but were of grave importance to governments and organizations for some reason or another. Mahan didn't know what to make of it. To him, it all felt like a kind of invisible war between secret societies that were somehow able to use governments and corporations like pieces on a chessboard for a bunch of old, moldy books and geometric trinkets from forgotten civilizations.<br><br>Now Mahan was pinned behind a crumbling wall in a village in the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya with his fallen unit scattered in pieces all over the surrounding dirt roads. He had been fighting all day against different units and was fresh out of luck and ammunition.<br><br>There’s no way out of here, he told himself. I’ve got no support, no ammunition, no luck. Why do you need luck when you have a weapon and your wits? You’ve been in worse situations and survived. Think you are beaten and you are beaten. I am beaten. You are almost beaten, and that’s not the same thing.<br><br>Suddenly, Mahan heard the surrounding mercenaries yelling at one another in Russian. They were planning an attack and coordinating with one another. He peeked around the corner, then ducked fast as several rounds punched holes into the wall sending clouds of dust and stone into the air. He cursed in Punjabi, grabbed his automatic rifle, then craned his head ever so slightly to see fast-moving silhouettes against the full moon closing in on his position. Quickly, he crawled into a nearby home and hid the asset—the ancient scroll—underneath several corpses of British agents he had killed just before the Russians had decided to join their party. Then he hid in the shadows, holding his rifle by the barrel, refusing to die without a fight.<br><br>They probably all work for The Collector, he told himself. Crazy rich man with too much time and money on his hands. Shah just wants to make sure he gets the scroll before another eccentric billionaire beats him to it. And from where does this prize come? It supposedly comes from a lost, elder civilization with advanced and forbidden knowledge. Nonsense, all of it. A bunch of ancient stories about pagan priests and barbaric rituals and cosmic deities told around a campfire. Ancient sci-fi, at best.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Mahan heard their almost inaudible footfalls before he saw them. His eyes narrowed and his face hardened as two mercs entered the moonlit doorway. With a groan, he launched himself into the air, smashing the butt of his rifle against one head and then the other.<br><br>Both mercs collapsed to the ground unconscious. A split-second later, Mahan yanked a loaded rifle from the hands of one of the fallen mercs and rushed through the doorway taking cover behind a well spilling over with thick buzzing flies like living black soup. Inside the well were the rotting bodies of those who had sought the scroll but had found death instead.<br><br>Mahan buried his nose in his arm and suppressed an instinct to retch. Then, seeing a merc, he lifted his rifle and pulled the trigger. Bullets tore holes through the neck and face as the mercenary staggered back and forth, then fell against a wagon with the pulpy head hanging by a shred of flesh.<br><br>As he searched the shadows for other mercs, Mahan suddenly heard the crunch of stone behind him. He whirled to fire—<br><br>A second too late.<br><br>Several rounds pounded into his Kevlar vest like a jackhammer, sending him stumbling backward into the black soup of death. A moment later the surviving mercs loomed over the mouth of the well as a thick black fog coiled around them like a snake.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Mahan closed his eyes and waited for a death that never came. Instead of a report ripping though the darkness like a clap of thunder, he heard a scream followed by a cry and then shrieks of agony. When he opened his eyes, the mercs were gone as though they had been erased by the fog.<br><br>Mahan struggled through the putrid blood and fluids to climb up and out of the well. As he pulled himself over the gore-covered mouth he noticed the world had been plunged into an abyss of fog. Before he could make any sense of what was happening, something snatched his ankle—hard—and tried to pull him back down.<br><br>Desperately, Mahan gripped the edge of the well and held on tightly. He looked to his feet where he saw multiple hands yanking and clutching at his legs. He held on for dear life but his hands slipped in the blood and gore and soon gave way. With a terrible cry, he fell back into the gore as boney hands clawed at his legs, his arms, his throat, his beard, his nose, his turban and pulled him deeper and deeper into the darkness.<br><br>Needless of pain burst inside his head as he drowned in thick, fermenting blood. He knew with a strange resignation that he was dying, or that he was already dead, and that he would never know his niece or what had become of her. After his wife and parents had died in a plane crash and his brother had disappeared, she was the only one left. She was his only family, and he swore he would always take care of her.<br><br>But then life happened, and in the end, he had only taken care of himself. He had lived a lonely, selfish life counter to his upbringing and his beliefs. He was a walking contradiction who had somehow convinced himself that he was cursed, that everyone he had ever loved died or disappeared, and that he was doing his niece a favor by staying out of her life. He had somehow convinced himself that he was keeping his bad luck away from her while he amassed a fortune that he would one day leave her.<br><br>But Mahan knew it was all a lie. He didn’t know the first thing about nurturing and raising a human being. Raising his brother’s daughter terrified him and that’s why he had clung to any reason he could to abandon her. All he knew was killing and destroying in the name of governments and corporations. And as the darkness swallowed him whole, Mahan realized in horror that killing and destroying was all he would ever know.<br><br>Mahan had failed his ancestors. He had failed his family. He had failed his brother and his niece. He would never know her hopes, her dreams, her likes, or dislikes… He would know nothing except the inky blackness that swept over his eyes and the unnamable terrors that awaited him in the great unknown.<br><br><br><br>MAHAN OPENED HIS EYES WITH A START. He was still in the well, submerged in the putrid, death stew, staring up at thick black fog drifting over him as he heard a whirring sound—the sound of a motor accelerating and decelerating somewhere in the distance. He took a moment to gather his senses. He didn’t remember much. He remembered being shot, stumbling back and falling into the well. Everything after that moment felt like a nightmare that had been inspired by one of his father’s stories—the one where unarmed, peaceful protestors were shot dead and stuffed into a well and left to rot in the blistering Punjab heat.<br><br>With a painful groan, Mahan reached out with trembling hands to a jutting rock and, with difficulty, pulled himself free from the gore. Rock by rock, he climbed his way up the festering throat of the well and finally pulled himself over the mouth and into the thick black fog.<br><br>A cry sounded over the incessant whir of the machine and Mahan quickly realized he wasn’t in Kenya anymore. He stood and took in his surroundings. There were strange structures like factories submerged in the fog. Scattered around the structures were piles of clothes and bodies set ablaze. Above in the pale red sky crows circled and cawed adding to the oppressive cacophony.<br><br>“Help… please…”<br><br>Mahan heard a woman crying for help coming from a bank of fog. Snapping out of his daze, he extended his hands and waved a tunnel through the fog, searching for the source of the sound.<br><br>“Help… someone… please… ”<br><br>The disembodied voice reached him again, and she somehow seemed close and far at the same time. He froze to listen carefully, but all he could hear was the incessant whirring of the motor accelerating and decelerating.<br><br>“Help…”<br><br>There it was again. He moved left, then right, and finally he reached a woman in pilot fatigues stuck in a trap of twisted barbed wire. Without a word, he pulled the metal thorns out of her legs as she winced and squirmed in pain with every movement. “I don’t know what happened or how I ended up here…” Her voice trailed away, and she seemed bewildered.<br><br>“What’s the last thing you remember?” Mahan asked as he struggled with the barbed wire.<br><br>The pilot stumbled back and answered with intermittent groans as she nursed her wounds. “I was on patrol… soaring through clear blue skies… when this black cloud suddenly appeared… and then the plane began to shake and break apart and… I don’t know… I was here…”<br><br>A sudden click and they both turned wide-eyed to face the barrel of a rifle. Behind the rifle a man in black fatigues appraised them. “Who the fuck are you two?”<br><br>Mahan raised a hand. “Wait! Careful… we’re not a threat. We’re just as confused as you.”<br><br>“Who are you and what are you doing in Texas? Are you CIA? Is this some kind of a test?”<br><br>Mahan gritted his teeth. “This ain’t a test. And I’m pretty sure this ain’t Texas.”<br><br>“Who are you?!”<br><br>The agent shoved his rifle in Mahan’s face. But before Mahan could answer a Japanese woman in a black and red kimono emerged from the fog, unsheathing a katana with a high-pitched ring. She yelled at them in Japanese, and Mahan extended a calming hand to her. “Please… put the sword down…” He then turned to the agent. “Please… put the gun down… let’s figure this out. “<br><br>“Who are you!” the agent yelled, pushing the muzzle in Mahan’s face. “I won’t ask again!”<br><br>“I can tell you who I am, but that’s not the question, is it?”<br><br>“Yeah! What’s the question, then?”<br><br>“Where?” Mahan said flatly, motioning to the destroyed factories, the craters and the smoldering piles of trash and bodies. “I should think the question is: Where? Where are we?”<br><br>Another voice came from behind. “He’s right, you know. “<br><br>Mahan turned to watch a man with a police jacket emerge from the fog. “We’re still trying to figure that one out… but right now we should all be asking: How?”<br><br>“How?” Mahan repeated.<br><br>“Yes,” the detective said. “How much time do we have before The Horror finds—”<br><br>Before he could finish his sentence, a shriek followed by and high-pitched whine startled them. A moment later a mass of melded humanity and machine came at them.<br><br>Mahan could make out several heads all shrieking battle cries in different languages attached to a patchwork of charred scraps from missiles, tanks, fighter jets, and nuclear submarines all bearing flags and strange logos of brands from different periods he vaguely remembered. He stared at this monstrous chimera in shock and wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at.<br><br>The Horror, he called it. Looks more like the embodiment of war—sponsored war.<br><br>Mahan swallowed a thickness growing in his throat as The Horror rushed the stunned agent and tore his head off, swallowing the terrified face and dripping neck like a ripe cherry. Then its ghastly mouth opened wide and a stream of fire torched the jerking, headless corpse as it collapsed into a heap of industrial garbage.<br><br>Not waiting to be next, the samurai lunged at the monstrosity and, with incredible speed and precision, cut it to pieces. Then all of them watched in disbelief as the pieces of flesh and metal slowly disintegrated into the living fog.<br><br>The detective sighed. “It will be back,” he said, appraising the samurai. “18th or 19th Century. Red Crown Clan. You’re not the first. We could definitely use your skills here.”<br><br>The samurai sheathed her katana and grasped at the fog as though trying to capture pieces of it to study—as though she recognized it.<br><br>Mahan approached the detective. “Where exactly is here?”<br><br>But the detective didn’t answer. He merely turned his back on them and walked away, saying, “Follow me… if you want to escape.”<br><br>Mahan took in a deep breath and gathered his senses. Then he took to his heels and followed the detective into the unknown with the samurai and the fighter pilot in tow.<br><br><br><br>MAHAN FOLLOWED THE DETECTIVE through a labyrinth of bombed-out factories and mountains of garbage set ablaze. At the center of this industrial hell was a giant machine with hooks and cameras and television screens of every possible brand and size broadcasting moments of Mahan’s life as though his brain was a Wi-Fi signal that could stream his memories—his darkest memories. And not just his memories, but the memories of the samurai, the pilot, and the detective. It was as though they had been selected by some unnamable and incompressible intelligence for mere entertainment.<br><br>The detective stopped when he reached what seemed to be a submarine hatch surrounded by a pile of smoldering trash and mangled, charred bodies.<br><br>“Get in!” he yelled, opening the hatch. “I'll explain what I know when we’re safe.”<br><br>“Where does it lead?” Mahan asked.<br><br>“Away from here,” the detective said. “And that’s all you should care about right now. We don’t have time for explanations. But when we’re safe, Ben will answer all your questions as best he can. Right now, you need to—”<br><br>A clanking noise suddenly interrupted him.<br><br>“Go, go, go!” The detective yelled as The Horror came at them from the shadows. Instantly, he pulled out his flashlight, distracting The Horror as Mahan and the others escaped down the hatch."
Arcus 34,Tome10_Observer,"There are countless horror stories about mist or fog in the chamber, and not all of them are related to The Entity. The Unknowns have done an adequate job at separating the relevant from the irrelevant stories, making my research on what others have written about this place and experience easier to conduct. What is it about the fog—and not just black fog—that has inspired so many stories throughout the omniverse"
Chamber of Blood. Twelve to Midnight. Dark Age to Come.,Tome10_Observer,"The sound of a bottle clanging against the ground greeted Haddie as she entered the half-burned building that had gone up in flames nearly a week ago. Thick, smoky air stung her nose as she stepped over shards of glass and heaps of charred wood. Bright city lights spilled through the shattered windows and crumbling walls. Carefully, Haddie picked her way across the floor toward the elevator, where she found the door leading to the stairs. A sign on the door warned her that the entire structure would be demolished in the morning.<br><br>There’s still time, she thought, as she ascended the narrow stairs. I’ve got a few hours to convince Max that he’s not crazy, that he’s not losing his grip on reality and that something is happening to our world. Something only a few of us can see and feel.<br><br>Haddie reached the last door at the top of the stairs and pushed her way onto the roof. There she spotted a man sitting on the ledge with thick, tangled hair and a weathered army jacket, drinking himself to oblivion as he stared out at the bright lights of the city.<br><br>She approached him slowly, and he didn’t react or even turn to regard her when she sat down beside him. She merely sat in silence, listening to the police sirens wail in the distance over the horns and the muffled music coming from the clubs and bars below. At last, she said, “I thought I’d find you here.”<br><br>Max took a few swallows of rum. “I don’t know you.”<br><br>“But I know you, Maxwell.”<br><br>“I don’t care where you’re from. I don’t want to talk.”<br><br>“Yes, I can see that. You want to drink.”<br><br>“Perceptive,” he said sarcastically, then extended the bottle toward her. “You’re welcome to join.”<br><br>“No, thank you, Mr. Holt.”<br><br>“How do you know my name?”<br><br>“I know much more about you, Max.”<br><br>“You CIA? FBI?”<br><br>“If I were, you’d already be dead,” Haddie said. “You were an Olympic Biathlon athlete. You were a soldier. Iraq. Syria. Afghanistan. You left the military after an incident and after that you kind of pulled yourself off the grid.”<br><br>“You know how to use a search engine. You get a gold medal. Now leave me alone to my quiet time.” Max raised the bottle and took another swig.<br><br>Haddie narrowed her eyes and looked to the shadows on the roof beyond him. She couldn’t see anything but she could hear disembodied voices talking to him. She shut them out, then leaned closer to him. “I know you see and hear things others can’t. I know they follow you. I know you want them to stop. And I didn’t get all that from a search engine.”<br><br>Max lowered the bottle from his lips and fixed his gaze on a couple arguing on the sidewalk below. “You don’t know what I hear… what I see…”<br><br>“Things from another place. Another world. Another realm.”<br><br>Max swallowed a growing lump in his throat.<br><br>Haddie paused, then continued:<br><br>“Something otherworldly attacked your unit and you survived because of your abilities and now… no one believes a word of it. You were ridiculed, discharged and silenced with an endless supply of opioids to fog your memory and neutralize your questions.”<br><br>Haddie stopped as his eyes filled with tears.<br><br>“You’re not crazy, Max. You saw what you saw, and no drug or drink in the world will relieve the guilt or stop the nightmares. And that’s why you’re here, isn’t it… Waiting for morning to make it all stop.”<br><br>Max cleared his throat. “What do you want?”<br><br>“Your skills and abilities on my team.”<br><br>“And what team is that?”<br><br>“The one that is trying to stop the end of the world.”<br><br>Max laughed uproariously, then stopped at once. “You’re serious?”<br><br>Haddie grabbed the bottle out of his hands, took a swig, handed it back to him and nodded gravely.<br><br>Max shook his head. “What do you know about what happened to my unit?”<br><br>“Not much,” Haddie admitted. “What I do know is there are some very powerful people who have the answers or think they have the answers you’re looking for. What I do know is that since I was a teen I’ve been caught in the crossfire between two warring groups that need people like us to access this other realm and bring things back. I’ve been running from them for the last forty years, and I have helped others like us from suffering an unknown fate at their cruel hands.”<br><br>Max’s face hardened. “They laughed at me. They said something in me snapped and that I had imagined the fog and the creatures that came out of it.”<br><br>Haddie shook her head. “You didn’t imagine anything. I lost my brother in the same way.”<br><br>They exchanged a look.<br><br>“He’s not dead… I can still hear him… I do… but I can’t see him…”<br><br>“Where is he?”<br><br>Haddied shrugged. “I don’t know. All I know is we’re not the only ones who lost friends and loved ones to this phenomenon. And if we work together we might one day see them again.”<br><br>Max laughed and pulled on his bottle. “So you’re recruiting me? Is that what you’re doing? Recruiting me in some kind of paranormal army.” He laughed, again in disbelief.<br><br>Haddie watched him laugh. “I’m giving you what you need.”<br><br>“And what is that?”<br><br>“A second chance,” Haddie answered flatly. “Purpose. Meaning. A chance to save others from being murdered or used by the same assholes who are coming for you right now as we speak.”<br><br>Max laughed. “What are you talking about? Who’s coming for me?”<br><br>“I have a list—”<br><br>Haddie broke off abruptly. She pulled out a gun from her jacket and shot two dim figures in the head as they emerged from the exit door. She then jerked to her feet and hurried to the bodies, searching their jackets for IDs without any success. “They’ll be more,” she said, looking up at Max as he stepped beside her with wide, confused eyes. “You’re at the top of their list and that’s why I’m here.”<br><br>“What list? What are you talking about?”<br><br>“Follow me,” Haddie said. “And I’ll explain everything.”<br><br>Max nodded, dropped his bottle with a loud clang, and followed Haddie down the stairs, through the charred building, and out into the ally where a cab was waiting for them.<br><br><br><br>MAX HOLT STOOD IN THE BASEMENT of the Park & Sherwood bookstore examining a wall of pictures, notes and numbers covered by a web of red string highlighting connections. He narrowed his gaze on hundreds if not thousands of missing people from all over the world. Tacked between the pictures and notes were transcripts of horror stories from various podcasts decoded into numbers and coordinates. He then glanced around the room and noticed artifacts and artwork from ancient civilizations he did not recognize from any history book he had ever read, and he had read many. He turned back to the wall and noticed for the first time a picture of his unit in Afghanistan among countless other units that were missing in action. His face grew stern, his eyes narrowed, and he turned to Haddie and asked, “Is this the list?”<br><br>Haddie stepped beside him. “This is the list of those we failed.” Her eyes fixed on a picture of her brother at a World War Two zeppelin crash site in the French Alps where they had recovered several “Wunder Weapons” that a secret unit of German soldiers was transporting for the Thule Society. It was the last time she had seen him before he had disappeared. “The list is of those that are being targeted by some very powerful and disturbed elites. They will either be killed in ritual sacrifice, or they will be used as tools to search areas that overlap with another dimension.”<br><br>“I don’t understand.”<br><br>“I know it’s a lot to take in. But these groups… they communicate through random podcasts and deliver encoded messages in stories and media. And we do our best to decode them.”<br><br>Max scoffed. “Is this some kind of joke? Codes in stories… That’s your list?”<br><br>Haddie shook her head. “This is real. There are people who are in serious danger, and you can help them. You left the government because they laughed and ridiculed you. That won’t happen with us. We know what you saw is real.”<br><br>Max approached the picture of his unit.<br><br>“I’ve got names and places and endless funds at my disposal,” she said. “We’re twelve to midnight, and only a few of us know it, and I need you on our team, not theirs.”<br><br>“Minutes?”<br><br>“Seconds. Twelve seconds.”<br><br>“These groups,” Max queried. “Are they that powerful?”<br><br>“You have no idea.”<br><br>Max extended his hand, touching the picture of his unit. He then followed a red string to a passage culled from a horror story. From the passage, he followed yet another string to a series of numbers—the time, day and place the creatures in the fog attacked them.<br><br>Haddie stepped away and soon returned with a folder, pulling out a picture of an abandoned cemetery in Chile along with a picture of a man. She handed the pictures to Max, and he stared at them for a long, thoughtful moment before nodding that he would join her team."
Chamber of Blood. Rabbits Attack Hiker in Colorado.,Tome10_Observer,"A hiker is in critical condition after being bitten by a dozen rabbits that escaped the Acendix Research Institute, an emergency responder said Friday. The hiker was bitten in the legs and face near Misty Lake, said national park ranger Steve Downer. The hiker’s condition was unknown Friday but doctors are optimistic."
Chamber of Blood. The Redcrane. Veil of Blood. 1.,Tome10_Observer,"Several paths lead to the harbor where peasants and merchants had witnessed the strange arrival of a foreign ship. They discussed the ship and the arrival in the surrounding villages with mingled anger, fear and curiosity. Most believed the foreigners were here to disseminate contraband and rob their beloved land of precious artifacts. Many believed a band of thieves was selling these precious goods to these foreigners in exchange for their weapons. Some even claimed that they had seen these thieves on the gangway, loading stolen artifacts and relics from fallen lords and noble families onto their ship.<br><br>Saku Nakano stood in the moonlight, considering her options. There was the long and safe route along the dirt road, and there were shorter routes through the dark and deadly woods where many unlucky villagers had been killed by creatures—it was said—not of this world.<br><br>Saku knew of these cursed places all too well. She had lost her entire clan to these mist-enshrouded areas over the years and now she roamed the country—the last of The Red Crown Clan—seeking out the great corruption that was upon her people, finishing what her clan had started centuries ago.<br><br>The enemies to her clan, The Black Serpent Society, served a nine-headed serpent made of black mist. They believed the black serpent would grant them powers and boons beyond human comprehension in this world and the next in exchange for unquestioning devotion. They were convinced that the black-mist serpent was a demon that slithered through these wooded cursed areas creating doorways into what they called The Belly of the Serpent, or just, The Belly.<br><br>Saku turned toward the dark woods, and sensing raw evil in her midst, she prepared to enter, thinking about the hushed conversations she had overheard in the nearby markets. She remembered the merchant hacking and gutting fish as he talked to a woman who was going through a bag of oysters she had just gathered in the sea. She remembered them talking about how they had seen bandits with pistols and gunpowder and other strange weapons.<br><br>I remember them mentioning the foreigners, she thought. They said they were Dutchmen. They were on the wharf speaking fluent Japanese with unknown merchants in plain kimonos with the exception of a strange serpent crest. They described the crest as a nine-headed serpent twisted in a circular knot as it chased its nine tails. They described only a few sailors and how most of the crew had perished of an unnamed disease during the voyage across the ocean.<br><br>A sudden laugh interrupted her thoughts.<br><br>“Where is your husband? “<br><br>A man in a plain brown kimono looked her up and down in the pearly light of the moon as he approached her.<br><br>Saku met his gaze but did not react or respond.<br><br>The man placed his hand lightly on the hilt of his sword as he continued to appraise her. She was tall and lean with strong, sinuous arms and piercing dark eyes. She had long, black oiled hair gathered in a perfect queue, doubled over and tied neatly with a red and white sash. She wore thong sandals and a simple black kimono. A vibrant red sash around her waist held two scabbard swords. One sword was short and straight, the other was long and curved at the tip.<br><br>“Where are your papers?”<br><br>The man edged closer to her with dim recognition in his eyes. He had heard rumors of an Onna-Musha in a black and red kimono roaming the land, destroying the wicked while protecting those who could not protect themselves. Or did she roam the land seeking justice for her butchered clan? Or was she a bandit leader who raided and pillaged villages?<br><br>The man couldn’t quite remember what he had heard, and he had forgotten the name people had given her. It was related to her clan and its origin. That much he knew, but not much more. It would have helped if he had paid closer attention when his wife had been discussing her many adventures with her sisters.<br><br>But he had ignored most of the stories as exaggerated gossip and legends not unlike that other samurai that everyone called a demon. There was no such thing as a demon samurai and there was certainly no such thing as a woman samurai that could perform all the feats the stories claimed she had performed.<br><br>Saku breathed deeply and placed her hand near the hilt of her long sword.<br><br>“Do you not see I am addressing you! Where are your papers! Answer me wo—”<br><br>With impossible speed, Saku whirled her sword in a gleaming silver arc and the man’s torso toppled off his hips and a fountain of warm crimson fed the ground. The twisted mouth twitched as it sputtered bile and blood and tried to make out the words, “Redcrane.”<br><br>He had remembered—<br><br>A moment too late.<br><br>Returning her sword to its scabbard, Saku sighed and said an inward prayer for the brute. Then she stepped over his jerking torso and entered The Belly of the Serpent.<br><br><br><br>WITH CAREFUL, SILENT STEPS, Saku pushed smoothly through The Belly, paying close attention to the lurking black mist slithering through gnarled trees that seemed to shift and waver with her every step, as though to intimidate her.<br><br>Don’t make a sound, she thought, stepping down a slope through noiseless shadows toward the sound of waves crashing against rocks. She was close to the wharf. She could smell the seaweed, fish and salt in the air.<br><br>There was also something else.<br><br>A strange heaviness in the atmosphere.<br><br>Staring up through the shaking canopy, she saw thick clouds marching across the sky. She sensed the floor moving, and looked down to see her legs completely submerged in the creeping mist. A moment later a branch cracked not ten paces away, and she knew she wasn’t alone anymore.<br><br>Saku neither ran nor hid. She froze, closed her eyes, listening carefully for threats approaching through the black mist that heaved and moved as though it were alive.<br><br>Saku knew she was somehow—as difficult as it was to explain—in two worlds at once. And she knew there were demons and monsters in the other world that hunted within these overlapping areas.<br><br>Saku didn’t know much about this other world. What she knew she had learned from her mother and father. The Black Serpent Society—they had once explained—believed the black-mist serpent was a living deity that consumed people, towns, civilizations and worlds.<br><br>The Black Serpent Society believed that within The Belly there was lost knowledge and power from all these consumed worlds that could help them usher in a golden age of peace, prosperity and abundance. Their dedication, their devotion, their ritualistic killings were, in the end, for the betterment of humanity.<br><br>The Red Crown Clan, however, believed the promise of a golden age was nothing more than a cosmic ruse—a shiny gold lure to snag minnows, fish and whales in the abyss.<br><br>With a deep breath, Saku sensed the threats were gone. She opened her eyes and continued through wavering light and shadow as the wind began to pick-up and the mist grew thicker. But then she stopped suddenly when she heard a familiar roar.<br><br>A thunderous roar that seem to shake the world.<br><br>This time she didn’t close her eyes.<br><br>She didn’t run.<br><br>This time she silently lowered herself by a tree as she heard the pounding footfalls of a giant samurai in shiny green and gold armor approaching. She heard him smashing bushes and trees with his kanabo as he searched for her in the shadows. She knew without seeing him that she was being hunted by the samurai that had been corrupted and turned into a demon by the Black Mist Serpent.<br><br>Her sister had told her many tales about this samurai. How he had once been a man of honor and conviction. How he had hunted and executed corrupt merchants and false samurai. How peasants and villagers began calling him a demon because of his savage methods. And how he had ultimately been turned into the very thing he hated most, the very thing the stories depicted him as—<br><br>The Oni Samurai.<br><br>The very same Oni her sister savagely battled long ago when they had been caught in the mist. She had escaped, her sister hadn’t and now all she wanted to do was take down this demon and make him tell her where she was.<br><br>But Saku knew better than to lose herself in the past. She pushed the memory of her sister out of her thoughts and instantly found her focus. She looked through a gap in the trees toward the wharf, where she saw orange specs of light against the wall of darkness that was the sea. She could make it. She could outrun him to a place where he could not follow.<br><br>Looking over her shoulder, Saku saw the giant samurai only ten paces away. He was decked in shiny gold and green armor, and carried around his back a massive leather bag dripping, thick blood at the bottom. A few heads jutted out of the bag and clouds of buzzing flies surrounded him.<br><br>The Oni searched the trees and bramble and was now only seven paces away. Unexpectedly, something jerked away from a bush and he launched at the creature and smashed it with his kanabo, losing his bag in the attack. The bag fell and dozens of heads rolled toward her.<br><br>One head stopped at her feet and stared at her with wide open eyes.<br><br>Saku gasped as she suddenly realized she was staring at her own face. She fixed her gaze at the other heads in the mist and thought that they all seemed to resemble her, as though this demon samurai had already decapitated her countless times before.<br><br>None of it made sense.<br><br>Impossible, she thought. It cannot be. And yet… it is… Have I fallen to the demon before? Are there others like me in the demon world that made him? But look… a scar!<br><br>Saku observed the head at her feet and noticed a long scar on the side of her face. She instinctively felt her own cheek where the scar should have been. It was proof that this was someone else, though she could not deny the resemblance was uncanny.<br><br>Saku swatted flies and reached for the head to get a closer look, but then she suddenly froze when she heard a terrifying roar not five paces behind her. In one fluid motion she dove into a thicket as the kanabo missed its mark. Without a moment to spare, she scrambled to her feet and turned just in time to see a gore-covered kanabo with the crushed head of a rabbit coming down on her with devastating speed.<br><br>Quickly, she sidestepped and withdrew her sword. An instant later she slashed off the demon’s arm with a roar of her own. But knowing the arm would grow back in the mist, she turned and charged away, desperately running for the beach. She had downed the demon before, but somehow it always managed to rise unscathed to continue the hunt.<br><br>There was no defeating the demon.<br><br>There was only one option: escape.<br><br>As she rushed through the woods, she turned back to see the demon chasing after her. She pushed herself to run faster and faster, and just as the demon lunged at her again, she dove out of the mist through a break in the trees to a place he could not follow.<br><br>The demon samurai stopped suddenly and watched her closely.<br><br>Saku clambered to her feet, brushing off sand, seaweed and salt. She turned to face the edge of the woods where she saw red glowing eyes fade into the night. Then she heard the crunch of rocks behind her followed by a clicking sound. She turned slowly to face the barrel of a musket pistol glinting in the moonlight."
Chamber of Blood. The Redcrane. Veil of Blood. 2.,Tome10_Observer,"SAKU LOOKED BEYOND THE PISTOL to a man in a dark kimono and short black hair. He inched closer to her with a smile, but she did not move nor give him the satisfaction of flinching. She met his gaze and edged back slightly. Then she stared off in the distance where she could see shadows moving about a cluster of abandoned homes near the wharf. The small village had been abandoned, no doubt, due to its proximity to the woods and the creatures that lurked within the mist.<br><br>The man cleared his throat and placed the barrel inches from her face.<br><br>Saku stared into his eyes without fear or concern. She looked down at his sandals and back to his eyes. “Move!” he ordered, his ignorant smile widening. “I know who—”<br><br>A sudden flash of moonlight and his head toppled off his shoulders before he could finish his sentence.<br><br>Saku watched the headless body spray warm blood into the cool night as it jerked left and right and finally collapsed into a mound of shells and seaweed, startling a nervous crab that instantly scuttled away into the gloom of night.<br><br>Saku gripped her sword and patiently picked her way through the jagged rock formations to reach the small village where Black Serpent brutes guarded the area against anyone who might try to interfere with their dark rituals and secret trade negotiations.<br><br>She moved silently through the shadows, following the edge of a home. She froze when she heard footsteps approaching. She slowly placed her back against the wall and waited. She peeked around the corner and saw two thugs telling stories about the demon samurai.<br><br>She crouched slightly, then, like a mighty tigress, she leaped into the air and thrust her sword through the two heads. They jerked violently then collapsed when she pulled her sword from their skulls.<br><br>She took a moment to survey the area, then made her way noiselessly to the wharf where three thugs laughed and made jokes about the strange red alcohol the foreigners had shared with them.<br><br>She held her sword firm, and she started toward them, practically gliding with quick, smooth steps. Just as one brute turned to meet her focused gaze she lunged with blinding speed and—<br><br>Three headless bodies suddenly staggered stupidly in the dark and collapsed into each other with arterial blood spraying darkness against the bright light of the moon.<br><br>Wiping warm blood off her face, she climbed a series of crates, moved past a clump of fishing nets, and crouched by the gangplank. She listened carefully for movement and heard steps just above in the ship.<br><br>When the footsteps receded to silence, she moved stealthily up the gangplank and halted, scanning the ship, spotting one thug sitting crossed-legged on a crate. Beside him were several other crates bearing the VOC logo and name of the Dutch East India Company.<br><br>Carefully, Saku embarked on the ship and moved toward the brute. But just as she prepared to pounce, she heard a click, followed by a high-pitched wheeling sound. It took her less than a moment to understand she had been lured into a trap—less than a moment too late.<br><br>Before Saku had time to react, she felt the heaviness of a net collapse over her as dozens of thugs surrounded her with dirty looks and curses. She then watched the sitting thug, the leader of the group, turn to face her.<br><br>The leader smiled, stood briskly, and laughed. “We thought you might show up?” he said as he approached her. He made a quick wave with his hand, and the thugs instantly trained musket pistols on her. “You’ve been quite busy interfering with our good work.”<br><br>She didn’t respond, but she pushed and pulled against the net to gauge its strength. She glared at him as she realized this was no chance ambush. The Black Serpent Society had been tracking her and had somehow managed to trap her. The leader shook his head at her.<br><br>“Your clan is destroyed. Your weapon is irrelevant and outdated. You’re outnumbered and trapped and still you think you can do the impossible.”<br><br>This will be difficult, she thought. But not impossible. I’ve been in worse situations and survived.<br><br>Saku inched closer to the leader as he smiled at her. She believed his reluctance to shoot her was evidence that they wanted her alive for one of their rituals.<br><br>The leader motioned to all the thugs and laughed, again.<br><br>Saku gritted her teeth and studied the thugs as they slowly closed in on her from every direction. She looked into the leader’s thieving dark eyes and saw all the lies and treachery of the Black Serpent Society. Then, looking beyond his eyes, she visualized herself triumphing against her enemy, leaping from thug to thug, cutting them down with her sword like weeds.<br><br>Suddenly, the leader barked orders, snapping her back to reality. The thugs inched closer to her with hideous smiles and wide, nervous eyes.<br><br>“Surrender willingly,” the leader said flatly. “And we will reunite you with your clan—as misguided as they may have been.”<br><br>Saku understood his meaning.<br><br>He believed their rituals would open a doorway into the nameless realm where they were supposedly trapped and cursed to live out an endless cycle of life and death for reasons beyond comprehension.<br><br>Saku didn’t know what to believe. What she did know was that she wouldn’t allow these thugs the satisfaction of serving her on a sacrificial platter to the darkness they served and she had promised to destroy. She had made an oath long ago as a member of the Red Crown Clan to cleanse the world of the reeking corruption that was the Black Serpent Society, and she planned to honor that oath.<br><br>With the strength and power of her ancestors coursing through her veins, Saku instantly rushed forward, her hand thrusting through the net. Powerful fingers grabbed the leader by the scruff of his kimono and pulled him in. Then, using him as a human shield, she whirled as pistols fired and balls ripped through his belly, chest and skull.<br><br>Through the rising smoke from the pistols, Saku could see the thugs trying to reload. Without a moment to lose, she tossed her busted and shredded shield to the ground, and, with difficulty, she sliced through the net with her sword. A moment later, she was a hurricane of death and destruction, leaping from thug to thug as her hissing blade painted the deck red.<br><br>The thugs didn’t know what to do. They were too stunned to react. It was like fighting a ghost, a monstrous shadow, a formless mist with swords for claws. Their futile attempts to parry her attacks with pistols met empty air as limbs fell and heads rolled.<br><br>It was a horrible nightmare, as if by some strange, ironic twist of fate the Redcrane actually drew her power from the black mist serpent so that she was somehow a servant of the very darkness she had sworn to eliminate.<br><br>When the last thug fell with a gasp, Saku found herself surrounded by blood and carnage. She took in the stench of gunpowder as her gaze slowly lowered to a thug groveling like a maggot. She had sliced his legs at the knees and he was crawling away with nervous elbows that slipped with every move in the growing pool of blood.<br><br>Wiping the gore off her face and kimono, she blocked his path and crouched to face him. The thug looked up at her with widening eyes. A bleat of terror rose from his throat that rose to a shrill pitch as she raised her sword and ended his service to the Black Serpent Society.<br><br>Saku rose slowly, and searching the ship, spotted a cluster of oil lamps glowing and flickering atop a crate. With focused determination, she picked her way through the bodies and kicked the crate, sending the oil lamps scattering to the wooden deck below.<br><br>The lamps spat liquid fire and set the deck and lifeboat ablaze. Then, walking away from the burning ship, Saku considered everything she had just experienced.<br><br>Trapped. How did they know she was coming for them? How could she have taken the bait? How had she been lured so easily?<br><br>Enough. Warriors do not waste time with what ifs and what they should have or could have done. What matters now is the present and taking the next right step.<br><br>Where to now?<br><br>She couldn’t think straight.<br><br>Despite all her training, a flame of anger burst in Saku for her careless mistake. Yet, she repressed her frustration and knew there was no use for it. Anger would only cloud her judgment and waste her time. She needed to keep her composure because—<br><br>Her friends and family could not have perished in vain. Because she was the last of her clan. Because the Black Serpent Society had to be stopped. Because she the hope of all those who believed she would end the darkness that was upon their land. Because she was—<br><br>The Redcrane."
Arcus 41,Tome10_Observer,"The Mad Designer sketches are preposterous yet entertaining. I just went through hundreds of sketches of monsters and killers in tuxedos and golfing attire. Makes no sense, and yet I found myself pinning these absurd illustrations in my study. They have absolutely no value to my investigation, yet they made me smile, even laugh, and, perhaps that’s enough. Perhaps helping me forget the horrors of this place even for just a moment turns the absurdity of these designs into a kind of medicine. As much as I take offense to the complete disregard the Mad Designer has for these characters… I can’t help but search the Chamber of Blood for more Emperor Dwight illustrations. They are—so far—my favorite."

They’re waiting for the perfect moment, which will never come, for I have barricaded every door and window and practice savage and efficient combat maneuvers with my nine iron. I’ve caught glimpses of their forms, and they are ever-changing, as though imitating all the monsters I’ve read about in my favorite stories, as though the fog itself were an extension of my dark imagination and fears.

Memory 9107,Tome10_Pig,"Amanda feels her heart racing as the test subject screams on the television screen. She observes him as he looks down at the see-through cylinder pressed against his bare abdomen. Several rats are trapped inside the cylinder, screeching against the subject's skin. The thermometer inside displays 97 degrees Fahrenheit. The rats are agitated, stuck between the glass and his stomach. They cannot escape the heat. Amanda is pleased to see the subject cry as rats claw at his skin. Then he succumbs to his flaw, activating the trap’s last mechanism. Amanda feels a jolt of adrenaline as a board rises inside the cylinder glued to the subject's abdomen, opposite to the ravenous rats, letting through a hissing cobra.

But her heart sinks when she is welcomed by John’s exhausted frown.<br><br>He wipes the sweat off his brow and praises her efforts but criticizes her plan. Suffering seemed to be the trap's sole design. Pain can be used as punishment, but first it must be offered as redemption.<br><br>Amanda frowns. After all her hard work, how could he doubt her? His teachings are law. This new chance in life is too precious for her to squander away. She looks up as John leans over the table to catch his breath. His inhale turns into a coughing fit and she hands him a bottle of water. Amanda can see that their time together is limited. There can be no room for mistakes. She will be his successor and continue what he started."

Less so before a test. The excitement keeps her wide awake.<br><br>Amanda's eyes fall on the large folder in John's hands. Another test?<br><br>John nods. He is compiling information on Grace Wright, an amiable politician campaigning for the upcoming election.<br><br>Amanda watches him as he massages his temples. He looks worse than last week. How long did she have to learn everything about his craft? A few years? A couple of months?<br><br>To protect their legacy, she needs to be ready when the time comes.

The elections are tonight.<br><br>Several sheets slide over the printer's tray, falling at Amanda's feet. She snatches them from the ground. Earlier today, she broke into Grace’s inbox to find her flaw. The test must be perfect. Perhaps John will be able to rest once he is convinced that his life's work is in capable hands.<br><br>Amanda pores over a series of documents and emails exchanged between Grace and a lawyer from ten years ago. A certain Ben Fairfax threatened to expose a scandal relating to when Grace joined the city council. The lawsuit was settled swiftly.<br><br>But the emails continued between Grace and her lawyer. Amanda found a report showing that Zanix industries, a copper exporter in the area, poured waste directly into the Hillford river, contaminating the ground water. The city's decayed, century-old water lines were unable to filter the filth. Grace covered up the lawsuit to avoid adding to the city’s increasing taxes. For ten years, filth has been poured into the water of Grace’s oblivious voters.<br><br>Amanda looks down at the glass of water sitting on her desk.<br><br>She dumps it into the sink and grabs a bottle of vodka from the freezer.

They always betray him.<br><br>The stroll up the sidewalk to Mister and Misses Sarenko's home is brief. He wishes he could stretch it out, take each step slower than the last. But this was his choice. He volunteered to tell them their missing son, Shane, is dead.<br><br>Should have taken the vacation. Could be on the beach frying up slabs of meat. What the hell was I thinking?<br><br>He was so close to getting on that plane. At the airport, waiting to board, his wife's hand reaches out, locks her fingers around his, squeezes tight.

He's a spectator, torn between offering condolences and leaving them to their grief. Either choice lacks sincerity. All these years and he still doesn't know what to do. No one ever does.<br><br>The father screams and it reminds him of Shane. It brings him back to where it started, as memories from hours past take over. He remembers it clearly…<br><br>He arrives at the factory. It's abandoned. He snoops around, checking for signs of forced entry. Twenty minutes pass. No footprints, broken windows, or snapped fences.

This is one hell of a vacation.<br><br>There's an apology forming somewhere, but it sounds no different than the past few. Still, better put something together before he heads home.

Chai spice. Wife used to make it for him when they started dating. Didn't like it then either, but he'd drink it anyway. It made her happy. Maybe it made him happy too.

Mrs. Sarenko dabs her eyes as she recalls the last year of Shane's life.<br><br>Such a gentle boy, that one. He was brokenhearted over his fiancé leaving. Wanted to make things right with her but… never really did. She just kind of got away. And he fell apart. Dropped out of college, drifted day to day without a path to stand on. Never really recovered… stopped living, I guess. Lost that sparkle.<br><br>Tapp reacts with a consoling look, but inside he's mentally recording the information for his report. Testing those who have given up on life—it fits Jigsaw's M.O. Shane lost his will and abandoned his future, that's some kind of sin in this madman's book. The sick asshole strapped the poor kid into a trap to teach him a lesson. Discomfort being necessary to mend a broken heart? Could be. At this point, he knows Jigsaw better than he knows anyone. Ah… shit. Anyone? He tries to rattle the thought from his head, find some other memory to torture himself on. Ms. Sarenko's voice in the background decides for him.<br><br>Shane. He had the chance to save him and he blew it."
Memory 4103,Tome10_Tapp,"The scene plays over again in his head, beating against his skull like a bad hangover.<br><br>His eyes adjust to the darkness of the abandoned factory.

As much as the guilt rises in his throat like bile, he knows he has to play his role in this ritual.<br><br>He takes the photo. A young Shane, dressed for prom smiles at him. A bright, eager grin.

Another one. No luck.<br><br>Footsteps patter along the concrete. The cloaked figure emerges from the shadows and makes a run for it. There's still time to catch them.

She crouches and slowly sneaks past him.<br><br>When she reaches for the basket of fruit, she sees what lies under it: cured cheese. She grabs a large piece and shoves it in her bag with a few apples. Then she crouches under the stall and exits the opposite way she came in, leaving the vendor behind.<br><br>Walking hurriedly, she heads down the street, where beggars are kindling rubbish. Despite the stank, the warmth of the flames feels good.<br><br>Suddenly, a heavy hand falls on her shoulder. A towering man with a bow in his hand is staring down at her.<br><br>He smiles menacingly.

She bites her tongue to stifle her cries, tasting blood.<br><br>Once at the top, she hides behind the oak tree to catch her breath. But her vision blurs and she collapses into a pile of dead leaves.

Then she tightens her scarf around Victor to keep him in place.<br><br>She reaches the cliff and grabs the rock wall. One foot up. Then another. Her arms tire first. She lands her right foot on a protuberant boulder and shifts her weight to relax her muscles. But her heel slides out of her oversize boot. Ignoring her aching arms, she holds onto the cliff, pushing her foot hard against the boulder to force the boot back on. But the boulder shifts under the pressure and comes loose.<br><br>Suddenly, there is nothing but air under her right foot. The boulder tumbles down the cliff along with her boot, plunging into the river. Charlotte’s arms are shaking, and she cannot move. Her fingers are slipping away, one by one. Soon, she will tumble down just like that boulder, and plummet to her death.<br><br>Her breathing becomes ragged. Is this the end?<br><br>She promised Victor she would save him. That one day they would be free. Is this the best she could do? A brutal plunge to their death?<br><br>No, she promised him. She would save him.<br><br>Like she saved maman?<br><br>Charlotte closes her prickling eyes.<br><br>Her last finger is slipping."
Memory 6905,Tome11_01,"Charlotte feels something cold against her shoulder. She opens her eyes and sees Victor's hand there. That is their signal. He would tap her shoulder when he needed something. She would hold his hand when she needed his attention. But he is too weak to move. Did he change position when the boulder slipped from under her? Unless… he is afraid, like her. Maybe he is begging her to save him.<br><br>Charlotte inhales deeply, ignoring her burning arms. She looks up and sees another large boulder to her right, a bit higher. If she lunges, she could reach it. But one false move and she'd land in the river, her head smashed on rocks.<br><br>Her heart is beating wildly, but she is no longer paralyzed. Victor needs her. And she would do anything to save him.<br><br>Digging her nails into the rock wall, Charlotte pulls with all her might and jumps. As she lunges into the air, her heart drops. Then her right foot lands on the higher boulder, which instantly shifts from under her. Terrified, she realizes that she is falling—slowly. Frantically grasping at the wall, she sways her arms, ignoring the sharp rocks tearing and burning her flesh. She closes her eyes as she slides down… but her right arm finds a grip, bringing her fall to a stop.<br><br>As she holds on, her right foot lands on something solid, and she carefully shifts her weight on it. Her ears are ringing wildly, and her whole body is pressed against the jagged edge of the cliff.<br><br>She looks over her shoulder at Victor. He is cocooned in her scarf, safely.<br><br>Gritting her teeth, Charlotte looks up. The edge of the plateau is about a Toise high. She can do this.<br><br>Charlotte finds a grip for her left arm. Then she pulls. One foot up. Then another.<br><br>On and on for what seems like an eternity.<br><br>All the way up, until she heaves herself over the edge of the plateau, safe."
Memory 6906,Tome11_01,"Charlotte collapses on the plateau. For a moment during the climb, she thought it was over. The fear of death is nothing to be ashamed of. But something else happened. For a second, she felt a fleeting relief when contemplating death. And that worries her more than the witch hunters. More than the black cloaks. Because it means that she betrayed Victor. For a moment, she abandoned him. How could she be so cowardly and… selfish?<br><br>Charlotte presses her hand over his cheek. Ice-cold. Isn't he already gone? No. She couldn't accept that. Losing him would be like laying down in a grave and waiting for soil to smother her. He is her. And she is him. They are one.<br><br>She caresses his pale cheek. I promise you that one day I will take you far away from here. And we will be safe, forever.<br><br>A dark fog coils at her feet as her eyelids become heavy… Then her eyes close."
Memory 6907,Tome11_01,"Charlotte opens her eyes. She sits up slowly… she must have fainted? Instead of looking at the view, she looks down at Victor, who seems asleep. Is he…? No. Charlotte could see some color on his cheeks. He will get better.<br><br>Getting back on her feet, she examines her surroundings. A forest of evergreen trees stands ahead. And behind her… she gasps at the view. Tall pines spread west to the shoreline, where dark waves roll against a long bobbling wharf. A harbor of ships heading west.<br><br>To admire the ocean view, Charlotte sits on a bed of soft branches. The sun is setting, spilling blood into the sky. She loosens her scarf, unveiling Victor's face so he can see the boats. She reaches for his hand and grabs it. Ice-cold and limp.<br><br>Charlotte stifles a sob. Everything is fine. Victor is just weakened by their journey. He is still here, with her. Tonight, they will rest, and he will get better.<br><br>Below, large ships are sailing toward the misty horizon, heading further west. They remind her of her mother's dream. When the black cloaks were doing their worse to her, she held onto her mother's words. Charlotte never honestly believed in her mother's dream of sailing west. It was just a beautiful escape. But now it is time to believe. A new dream for a new life.<br><br>Charlotte takes off her hat and wraps it around Victor's hands. Do you know what lies beyond the horizon? Maman told me once. She dreamt of that place, just before she fell sick. She said that there is another world across the ocean. A place with clean rivers and sweet syrup dripping from the trees. A whole other world for us to be free. Do you see that big ship below?<br><br>No answer. Maybe Victor is afraid of dreaming aloud. Some dreams are too delicate to be spoken. But not hers.<br><br>Charlotte brushes off a drop of rain from Victor's pale brow. Everything will be alright, Victor. Just imagine the voyage with me. One day we will sail far away from here. We would sleep in a bed made of ropes, suspended in the air. Each rolling wave would swing our bed from side to side, lulling us to sleep. After a few weeks, we'd reach land. Then, we would find a little house by a creek. In the morning, we would work in a field of golden crops. Each day we'd drink the sun and eat the moon. And no storm would hit us. No men would burn us. No monsters would hurt us. We would live together, free. Our lives would be so normal, you would miss our adventures. Maybe one day, you'll even miss this view… I promise you. One day we will be free. We'll find a place where we belong. All three of us.<br><br>Her voice breaks. No, they could never be all three again. Their mother is gone. Charlotte looks down at Victor. He is so weak that she could barely see his chest rise.<br><br>No, he is just sick. He needs to rest. She cannot pay her doubts any attention. If she does, she would be the next one to die. And then all three of them would be lost.<br><br>Charlotte closes her eyes. She can almost feel the lush leaves brushing against her legs as she runs through an open field. Victor is laughing in her arms. They are far away from here…"
Memory 6908,Tome11_01,"Cold winds howl against the cliff like hungry beasts. A songbird wakes Charlotte. She opens her eyes, feeling every inch of her body protesting in pain. Her throat feels coated in sand. Her temples throb. She feels sick.<br><br>She looks down at Victor who got paler overnight. Her fingers curl into a fist. How is she supposed to take care of her brother when her own mother failed? Charlotte feels so lost without her.<br><br>Looking up, she spots the singing bird: a little sparrow. Images flash through her mind: soft feathers, sharp claws, and a delicate neck in her hands. Blood dripping from her brow as black cloaks beat her, until she wrapped her hands around the sparrow's neck and twisted. They forced her to do monstrous things. But she is no monster.<br><br>Yet she was treated as one. And why? Because Victor is part of her, and she is part of him. They are one, united by blood and bone. They cry double the tears when hurt. They laugh twice over when glad. And even in their darkest moments, they are never alone.<br><br>Side by side, forever. Who else could say the same? And yet, they pay a heavy price for this gift.<br><br>They are of one blood and bone. If one perishes, what remains"
Memory 6909,Tome11_01,"The night sky is clear and speckled with stars. Charlotte feels too sick to move. Victor must feel worse. Or does he…?<br><br>A low feral growl echoes from the woods. Charlotte can barely see ahead, but the hair on her neck rise—something in the dark watches her.<br><br>She grabs Victor’s hand. Stay calm.<br><br>Holding a large branch in her trembling hands, she walks toward the noise. Wolves are known to hunt far from villages. The further she travels, the higher the risks of running into one.<br><br>While scanning the darkness, she spots a crimson trail on the glittering snow. Further ahead, a large wolf is lying in the snow, its gray fur marred with blood. An arrow is planted in its neck. Hunters must have left it to die.<br><br>The wolf growls as its dark eyes land on her, but seems too weak to move. Then she hears a high-pitch cry. A little white cub hides under the wolf's leg. A dying wolf and its wailing baby, striving to survive.<br><br>Charlotte knows what she must do. And she hates herself for it.<br><br>She leans over and grabs the tiny pup into her hands. The pup snaps at her fingers, but its teeth are too tiny to cause any real pain. Howling, the wolf struggles to get back on its feet, but its legs buckle under its weight and crash into the snow.<br><br>Charlotte ignores the dying wolf's whimpers and digs a hole in the snow, too deep for the pup to climb out of. When Charlotte's own mother screamed in agony, she wished someone would have ended her suffering.<br><br>Charlotte approaches the pup's mother with trembling hands. The wolf growls as she grabs the arrow. In one swift motion, she pulls it out. The wolf howls in anguish and collapses. The cub cries in response, frantically digging itself out of the snow. Charlotte waves her branch at the pup and screams. Run! RUN!<br><br>The pup growls weakly… then darts off into the night.<br><br>Charlotte's vision blurs as tears mingle with the blood splattered across her face. Is she any better than these hunters? The wolf was too far gone. Such unnecessary pain was cruel. And the hunters would have trapped its pup, if it remained close. A life of captivity with its mother's killers.<br><br>No, Charlotte did them both a mercy. She knows what it's like to be captured by such monsters."
Memory 6910,Tome11_01,"Charlotte's tears would not stop. Her remorse for killing the wolf triggered a growing tightness in her chest. Two years ago, she would never have been able to kill another being. And yet, is it humane to watch an innocent being suffer cruelly to death? She would have preferred walking away. But she knows better.<br><br>Her mother's suffering taught her better. When her mother was captured by witch hunters, Charlotte convinced herself that there was nothing she could do. But it was not entirely true.<br><br>The hunters slept in a wooden shed behind the church, near the woods. The shed was so old and dry, a spark could have sent it blazing. And yet she did nothing but wait for the trial. Then she had to watch her own mother burn to death.<br><br>There had been other missed opportunities to prevent the suffering of innocents. Every time, her mother's voice held her back: let no one pull you so low as to hate them. In the end, you will hate yourself most for it. But maman is gone now. Charlotte watched the flames melt her face as she cried out in agony.<br><br>Now Victor is all she has left. She looks down at him. His cheeks have a bluish hue. Maybe he is past the point of no return.<br><br>Isn't she?<br><br>No, he will get better. They are one, united by blood and bone.<br><br>He would never leave her behind."
Memory 6911,Tome11_01,"A loud noise wakes Charlotte at dawn. A pile of ashes lies at her feet, the fire long gone.<br><br>Something cracks behind her.<br><br>A tall man emerges from the tree line. She remembers him—the villager who tore out her bag at the market. He raises his arm, revealing his bow.<br><br>Charlotte's heart drops as she sees him draw. Stumbling to her feet, she darts off into the woods. As arrows land besides her, she keeps her eyes fixed on the ground to avoid protuberant roots.<br><br>Panicking, she rushes her step and her left foot lands on a stump, twisting her ankle awkwardly. She tumbles down to the ground. An arrow lands next to her face, slicing her cheek.<br><br>Charlotte stifles a scream as she gets back on her feet. Her ankle is throbbing painfully. Then something sharp stabs her leg, and everything slows down. Falling to her knees, she looks down and sees an arrow planted in her calf. A jolt of electricity courses through her. She screams in agony.<br><br>Panting, she looks down at Victor. His eyes are blank, as if ready for death.<br><br>She promised him…"
MEMORY 384,Tome11_02,"The old pub erupts in drunken screams and laughter as patrons drink ale, play darts and watch football on the flat-screen television above the bar. David sits alone on a hard wooden stool at the bar. He can already see Jasmine in his mind’s eye. Blond hair, blue eyes, short skirt, walking out of her apartment with wafts of wild vanilla and a few fun quips like all those black and white films his mother used to watch alone in the kitchen. She’s everything like the movies. Everything his father admires in a woman and more, and she’s certainly a perfect date for the Ol’Man’s retirement party in the coming days. Sure to turn heads and make him proud.<br><br>David gulps his evening ale, winces at the bitterness, and thumps the pint against the metal countertop, still feeling the tightness around his neck and shoulders. He figures he needs a little more social lubricant to make this first date go off without a hitch. The last thing he wants is to screw things up before the party.<br><br>David scans the bar and gestures to his old friend Rik. He slides his empty glass, nods for a refill and suddenly feels a sharp pain at his left side.<br><br>Rik returns with a foamy golden pint dripping on the sides as David snatches it from him, takes a sip and winces. Tastes bitter, and he knows it ain’t supposed to be this bitter.<br><br>He waves Rik over and leans forward. This shit is killing my insides. And it tastes like someone farted in a bathtub of donkey piss. You pulling this shit out of an engine, or is it real?<br><br>It's real, Dave. As real as it gets.<br><br>Tastes like poison.<br><br>Well… why don’t you stop punishing yourself.<br><br>David’s left side pulls, again. He struggles to remember if the appendix is on the left side or the right side. He isn’t sure. Doesn't matter. Everything hurts in his stomach and chest, and he figures he’s better off with a ruptured appendix, anyway.<br><br>Some poisons are good for you.<br><br>Rik shakes his head in disagreement. I'd take it easy anyway, unless you want to be a total shit with what’s her name.<br><br>Jasmine.<br><br>A drunk fan approaches David. Look here! As I live and breathe, David-fuckin'-King! Why not come have a seat with us?<br><br>Ignoring him, David looks up at the football match. Just want to be alone right now—another time.<br><br>Come on! Won't you take a few seconds for a fan?<br><br>David locks eyes with Rik, but doesn’t look at the drunk brute at his side. I appreciate the invitation but I'm kinda going through a rough patch. It's why I'm alone… so please…<br><br>The drunken fan jabs him in the shoulder. I gotta ask. What did that referee call you that upset you so much?<br><br>You have shit in your ears? Get away!<br><br>The fan jabs David, again. David catches the finger, snaps it against the joint, and takes another sip of donkey piss as the agonized fan falls to his knees, screaming bloody murder.<br><br>Rik quickly gestures to a giant of a man who escorts the drunken fan and his entourage out the door before all hell breaks loose. Then he shakes his head at David. One day you're gonna to pick a fight with the wrong guy. I told him I wanted to be alone.<br><br>There was probably a better way to tell him… unless that was about something else.<br><br>I broke his finger. Nothing more to make of it.<br><br>Rik’s eyebrows furrow. Come to think of it, you never did tell me?<br><br>Tell you what?<br><br>What happened with the ref?<br><br>David shrugs and shakes his head. He said the wrong thing at the wrong time and I lost my shit. Doesn't matter. Yeah, I can see how much it doesn’t matter.<br><br>David sighs at the sarcasm, and he feels Rik’s eyes on him as he takes a swig, then swallows it all down. Like I said… doesn’t matter.<br><br>Ahh… Secrets. What depths lie beneath the surface, Mr. King. What depths, indeed. I’ve known you sixteen years now and you’re still a closed book. You'll tell me eventually.<br><br>Rik grabs his empty glass and walks away."
MEMORY 393,Tome11_02,"In the rainy darkness of night, David staggers down a street he doesn’t recognize, drenched, cold, singing some half-remembered folk song. The last thing he expected was a fairy tale ending, and, of course, he understands Tristan needs time to think things through. How much time? Hopefully, not much. Just enough for him to step off the plane and call him to say…<br><br>…As you wish…<br><br>Shit!<br><br>Now he remembers!<br><br>At exactly the wrong moment.<br><br>David smirks. Doesn’t matter. He’s never felt so good, so free, so euphoric in his life. He lets the feeling flow past him like a gentle breeze and gets the sense that he’s been born again, or born for the first time, and that before this night he had merely existed as a cardboard cut-out with little self-awareness except for the fear that had come to rule his life.<br><br>His hope is that when Tristan’s plane lands he will receive a phone call asking him to be on the next plane out. If, that is, he ever finds his wallet. No matter. If he can walk home from the airport, he can swim across the pond. He laughs to himself and figures his wallet will turn up somewhere. It always does.<br><br>But what if he calls to say it’s over.<br><br>The thought catches him by surprise.<br><br>That’s probably what will happen. Truth is, love doesn't triumph and our fears get the best of us, always. That’s why fairy tales are written. To escape the endless disappointments and heartaches of real life. Regardless of what you think, your love isn’t strong enough, and when he calls it’s only to tell you it’s over. For good. Because he won't let you break his heart, again.<br><br>David drowns the thoughts by singing louder and louder. Then he stops suddenly when he sees a park he half recognizes. It resembles a park where he and Tristan used to sit on a bench and people-watch all day.<br><br>He enters the gates and for a moment he hears Tristan’s voice singing with him. He stops. Looks around, but doesn’t see anything through thick, slanting sheets of rain.<br><br>David continues through slumbering bushes and sagging flowers under a thick canopy dripping and pit-pattering with rain. He walks ahead until he hears a soft whisper.<br><br>No more bullshit.<br><br>He turns to face—<br><br>Tristan.<br><br>He rubs his puffy eyes and stares with disbelief.<br><br>Tristan laughs. Only you could massacre a line like that.<br><br>It can’t be… it’s… impossible…<br><br>David narrows his gaze on Tristan’s silhouette. He must have somehow disembarked the plane. Or maybe he never boarded in the first place. He doesn’t really understand what’s happening, but he knows better than to overthink his luck.<br><br>David runs to embrace Tristan but just as soon as he touches him, he withers away like a dead flower. With a gasp, David drops to his knees, hopelessly trying to catch the falling petals that melt in his hands and drip through his fingers into a gathering fog.<br><br>He barely has time to register what’s happening when he hears footsteps squelching in the mud and water all around him. He looks up slowly to see every single bully, abuser and shithead he ever took down advancing on him. His gut reaction is to pinch himself, yet nothing happens when he does.<br><br>With a deep sigh of resignation, David rises to his feet, lifts his chin and throws himself into the fray. He tackles and swings and kicks until he’s the last man standing with slithering tendrils of black fog pulling him down into a world of darkness untouched by the light of love."
MEMORY 385,Tome11_02,"David feels his lips and tongue growing heavier and heavier with every pint. He continues to brag about his new white shirt, his new cologne, and his new friend, Jasmine. He tells Rik about how he met her at a fountain where a famous photographer was taking her picture and everyone stopped to spectate and take in her beauty. He search’s Rik’s face for signs of approval but gets the sense that he’s just nodding to be nice.<br><br>You should have seen her. Every guy was staring at her. She was in this bikini and the summer sun was blazing down on her. Every guy was staring at her… and she was staring at me…<br><br>You said that part a few times now.<br><br>Did I?<br><br>Yeah. Starting to sound more like convincing than bragging.<br><br>David frowns and stares into space for a long moment. Then he puts his hands into his pocket and feels the hard tape holding an old note together. I ain't trying to convince you of anything.<br><br>I didn't say you were trying to convince me.<br><br>Who then?<br><br>That’s the question, isn’t it?<br><br>I don’t understand. What’s the question? Stop talking like that.<br><br>Dave… why don’t you stop talking like that. You come in my pub talking about supermodels and exploits you could sell to a smutty magazine, and you're good at it, too. And if I didn’t know you, I'd buy it.<br><br>David winces and turns away.<br><br>So here you are talking about how happy you are while you’re frowning and breaking fingers and ready to take down the first one who talks to you wrong. And you’re probably the only one getting in your own god-damn way.<br><br>You don’t jab people in the arm. You just don’t do that.<br><br>You can believe you’re happy if you want to, but from where I’m standing, you’re the most miserable bastard in Manchester, and I care too much about you to let you think you’ve got me fooled.<br><br>There you go trying to psychoanalyze me again. Probably going to link me to some obscure historical idiot nobody remembers that you read about in one of your dumb books.<br><br>Rik shakes his head. There you go making light of something serious when a friend just wants to know if you're okay.<br><br>There you go being melodramatic when a friend just wants a drink.<br><br>Dave… I'm sure she's a nice girl, but you know what I say. Screw her. Don’t go. Stand her up and do what you really want to do.<br><br>Stop talking outta your ass.<br><br>Rik leans closer to him. I'm serious, Dave. As serious as the note you keep in your pocket. You know… the one you read every now and then when you think no one's watching.<br><br>David leans away from him. Mind your fuckin' business!<br><br>Touch a nerve, did I?<br><br>David drains the pint, wipes his mouth, and staggers off the stool. I’m fine!<br><br>And he pushes his way through drunken patrons and the thick wooden entrance doors, losing his balance and stumbling into the cool, indifferent summer night."
MEMORY 386,Tome11_02,"David senses someone following him as he hobbles past the alley beside the pub. He turns to see the disgruntled fan and his entourage of idiots. They yell and joke and bark curses at him. It’s all a jumble of words to him. But he gets the tone and the general intention.<br><br>The fan approaches him with a crooked finger. You should be thankful people remember you at all—you pathetic excuse of a human. The only reason they remember you is because you pissed your career away in a single flush.<br><br>David feels the blood boil up his neck and doesn't even realize he’s unleashing a flurry of punches until it’s too late. He stops to wipe the blood off his fist as an idiot tackles him into the dark alley. Another idiot charges him with a scream and smashes him into a brick wall.<br><br>David kicks off the wall and pushes them both into a dumpster. He whirls to punch another idiot who instantly hits the ground with a thud. Several others attack him. He stands his ground and dishes out pain and soaks up punishment until they collapse.<br><br>David looms over them, impressed by his strength, when suddenly someone kicks him in the back. He topples over as he feels an arm wrap around his neck, choking him like a boa constrictor. Through blurry vision he watches the idiots take turns punching and kicking him in the gut and face.<br><br>The boa releases David, and he collapses in the gutter with two tennis balls for eyes, a bleeding nose and a tooth he feels slipping down his throat. He crawls out of the alley and onto the sidewalk where people walk by him without taking much notice.<br><br>Then he turns on his back and stares at the stars glimmering beyond a broken streetlight, grateful he didn’t puke. Then again he was never one to puke. Not when he drinks. Not before a game. Not even before a family gathering."
MEMORY 387,Tome11_02,"David barely sees the legs of pedestrians walking around him. He hears them whispering, talking, laughing, and growing silent as they approach him. Once or twice he heard whispers about seeing if he needed help, but the whispers soon faded, and in the end, no one helped him. He didn’t want help, anyway. He stares at the blurring and fading stars and wonders what his life would have been like if he had just been like his parents. Then it dawns on him. He doesn’t even know what that means. He doesn't know who they are. He knows aspects of them, the status, the facade, the bullshit, but not the real them, not the secrets and affairs and addictions.<br><br>As David stares at the darkness above, he hears a woman tell her husband they should really do something about the poor, beaten man bleeding on the sidewalk. He sees their blurry shadows looming over him as they stare at him with concern. He hears a few more whispers, and then they move on with their hurried lives.<br><br>Through the mist in his mind he remembers a story of how someone died of a heart attack at a stadium because not one person stopped to see if the crumpled man on the ground clutching his phone for dear life was okay. One phone call would have saved his life.<br><br>Rik told him that story a while back. He can’t remember when or why but he had many useless stories he collected from friends and clients that he repurposed for small talk.<br><br>David closes his eyes for a moment. He breathes deeply and takes in the floral notes of his cologne like soft petals drifting on the night breeze. He’s glad his nose still works and that he’s not having a heart attack even though he feels as though someone kicked his heart out of his chest."
MEMORY 388,Tome11_02,"David feels someone lying down beside him.<br><br>Someone told me you were out here enjoying the breeze.<br><br>He recognizes Rik’s voice but doesn’t respond.<br><br>Nice night. I have never seen a night quite like this one before.<br><br>David sighs. Go away… please…<br><br>Rik ignores him. Kind of hard on the back but looking at the stars seems to balance things out.<br><br>Please…<br><br>Look at those clouds. There’s a storm coming. Better enjoy it while we can.<br><br>David turns to Rik and looks at him through puffy slits, but doesn't say anything.<br><br>You know coconuts kill more people than sharks. I looked it up because someone told me this story about a couple who had been together for years. The woman always wanted her husband to go into the water while on vacation but he was terrified. He didn’t want to be eaten by a shark…<br><br>…They go to the same place for twenty years and he never goes in the water. Then for her sixtieth birthday he decides he's going in. She's happy, and he's pumped. But as he walks to the beach… a coconut falls on his head. Dies right there on the spot.<br><br>You'd think that would have been what she remembered. She had been a customer for years and she never once talked about the coconut. Someone else told me about it. She told me about all the other things… but not that… And she used to make me jealous cause I think people who know who they love are the luckiest people in the world—mightier than the mightiest in a wasteland of broken hearts.<br><br>David clears his throat. Is that story supposed to cheer me up?<br><br>I'm not trying to cheer you up. I’m telling you that I'm jealous of you, Dave. And I’m not talking about Jasmine or the others.<br><br>There you go assuming things you don't really understand.<br><br>I understand you. I understand love. And I know enough to know it’s not something you squander even if in the end there’s a cosmic coconut waiting for all of us.<br><br>David closes his eyes.<br><br>Rik laughs softly. Her story would have made a pretty good movie. Except for the coconut ending. That would probably have to change.<br><br>David sighs heavily, and through a growing thickness in his throat, he whispers for Rik to leave him alone. To just leave him alone."
MEMORY 389,Tome11_02,"David opens his swollen eyes to find Rik staring at him.<br><br>I had this regular who stopped coming to the pub a few years back. Found out she was in jail. Imagine that, jail. Murder. Matter of the heart. She discovered her husband was in love with another woman, so she lured him to their country home, drugged him with sleeping pills, boarded up the doors and windows and set it on fire while he slept.<br><br>He woke up and tried to smash his way through the boards. But she was waiting for him with a hammer. As he tried to climb through the busted and burning wood—<br><br>Whack! Whack! Whack!<br><br>She smashed his arms, hands, shoulder with the hammer until he could scarcely move. All that remained was a terrible mess of a man trying to squeeze through busted boards with thick black smoke pouring past him like molasses. She stands there watching him dripping, burning, breathing, screaming, begging… and doesn't move until the police arrive.<br><br>David turns away from Rik but doesn't say anything.<br><br>Her husband cheated on her before, and it didn’t bother her, but this time, well, this time he was in love. That would make a good movie, too. Only she wouldn't kill him in the end, and he'd probably realize he was just going through a mid-life crisis. I never met someone I'd kill or die for, and I sometimes wonder what that would feel like… if I could do something like that…<br><br>David feels Rik’s eyes on him.<br><br>I think my longest relationship was one year. I was told my ego gets in the way and that I don't like compromise. And that's true. But what's also true is I haven't met anyone who made me want to compromise.<br><br>David takes in the sounds of pedestrians walking past them.<br><br>You know one client once told me that wolves either move in packs or alone or in a couple. Did you know that couples form such a strong bond… that when one dies… the other dies seconds after… As though wolves can just shut off life’s switch whenever they want. One soul following the other into the next world if you believe in that kind of thing.<br><br>David turns to face Rik. Please… I don't want to talk.<br><br>One more story, then I'll leave you. It’s a true story that happened a hundred years ago in a time when this kind of story wouldn’t have even be told. I don’t remember how they met but when Richard and Will first laid eyes on one another they fell in love, and they kept their love a secret because back then… you could be hung for… well… for not loving like the rest.<br><br>David feels a sudden warmth rising up his neck.<br><br>They had secret lives, but eventually they were caught. And while so many lied and trembled before the executioner, they refused to lie about what they had… what they had found in each other. With the noose around their necks they were given another chance to repent… but they didn’t… instead of fear… there was only love… and Will grabs Richard’s hand and kisses it as the executioner pulls the cart from beneath their feet.<br><br>David’s puffy eyes drip with tears as he sees the two lovers dangling from the gallows. He wants to say something but feels an invisible noose tightening around his neck, choking him, preventing him from unburdening his heart.<br><br>That would make a great movie.<br><br>David’s lips tremble. He wants to say so much, but the words just won’t come out, and he feels like he’s sinking deep into a world of mud. Then his face tightens and his whole body quivers as he tries to suppress the pain. Losing the battle, he erupts with gasps and broken words as he desperately tries to breathe.<br><br>And Rik grabs his arm, supporting him, holding him, preventing him from sinking deeper and deeper into the wasteland where so many have been lost and forgotten."
MEMORY 390,Tome11_02,"What was it about him?<br><br>The question stumps David. He takes a moment to gather himself. I couldn't say one thing… it was a bunch of little things that just made me feel good when I was around him. Everyone else makes me feel like I gotta be something I’m not. But not him.<br><br>I never did believe the press release.<br><br>My parents can't stand each other. They should have divorced years ago… but they keep up the show and have their secret lives… so I guess that's normal.<br><br>It works for some people.<br><br>I miss him. I miss us. I remember meeting him like it was yesterday. Just being with him was enough to know, and I knew right away that he was special and that he would somehow be an important part of my life. We met at music camp. I was seven and didn't want to go. Ironically, my mother forced me and I guess in a way she's the reason we met. I couldn't play any instrument…<br><br>…But Tristan… Tristan was something else… I liked listening to him play the piano… At first my mother was happy… I had a music friend… maybe I would end up a violinist…<br><br>…I guess she figured things out faster than I did because next thing I know she forbids him from coming over. She gave some excuse about his family being of improper standing.<br><br>Then the talks began. The responsibility of being a King. She tells me about the image of our family and the strength of our name and how I had pretty big shoes to fill… sacrifices for the family and all that bullshit. But she never said exactly what she meant. She always danced around what she really wanted to say.<br><br>David laughs. Tristan ended up going to the same secondary school as me. Funny how life works out. He used to write me notes… quotes… poetry… proverbs… smart-aleck comments he knew would make me laugh.<br><br>We got back together in secret and were together for years until he began asking me to be introduced to my parents. Couldn't do it. I broke up with him. He broke up with me. Crazy fuckin' cycle.<br><br>Last year… he wanted a real commitment… he was talking about a family and kids… I nearly brought myself to doing it… but I didn't… I broke it off… and broke his heart.<br><br>He didn't take it so well. Got pissed, and actually came to my birthday party at the pub… he just shows up… and he gives me a kind of Great Gatsby toast… and he hesitates… and I know what he wants to do… I know what he wants to say… but in the end he doesn't…<br><br>…Instead he says what good ol' pal I've been to him… and he makes a smart-aleck joke about how I'm a ladies man who will definitely never settle down… and with tears in his eyes… he finishes his toast with… To the importance of being King. Smart ass! And everyone toasts to it… even the Ol’Man.<br><br>King laughs, then stops suddenly. Tristan staggers out with his pint and leaves an old note on the table. Something he had given me in an English class while the teacher was massacring one of his favorite writers with ridiculous interpretations.<br><br>He called me a few days ago… invited me to a party at the Gold Lantern Cafe. A going away party… tonight… He's leaving for New York. Some piano gig. He's leaving with some guy he just met. They hardly know each other a month, and he’s following him to New York. How ridiculous is that?<br><br>Rik says nothing as they stare at the fading stars for a moment. Silent tears slip out of two narrow slits for eyes. David clears his throat and wipes the tears away with his arm.<br><br>You ever feel like just stopping?<br><br>Rik turns to David. I imagine you'd have to start before you could actually stop. Way I see it… you've always been this lion, taking down the bully, the asshole, the abuser. Ever since I’ve known you, I’ve admired you for that. You’re great at clobbering the shit outta of anything that gets in your way except maybe yourself. I figure you could try building things, growing things, nurturing things… things like you.<br><br>Rik squeezes his arm. You're a lion, Dave, and as much as you're going to hate me saying this… you're a circus lion tethered and dressed up like a clown. You need to tear the rope and costume with your own claws and teeth if you ever truly want to know what it's like to be you.<br><br>You want to stop something… stop jumping through hoops… stop being the clown and just be the god damn lion you were born to be. You're about to regret something for the rest of your life and you know it.<br><br>David stares into space.<br><br>Rik squeezes his arm, again. Way I see it… you owe someone a toast.<br><br>You're an idiot if you think I'm just gonna walk over there and crash his party.<br><br>You're an idiot if you don't run."
MEMORY 391,Tome11_02,"David charges down the street and pushes his way inside the cafe. Scanning the room, he doesn’t see Tristan or his party. He yells at a waitress from across the room, and to his horror, she tells him Tristan already left for the airport. Her words stun him like a slap in the face. He’s too late, and his whole world is spinning out of control. He takes a moment to gather himself, then he decides and rushes out into the street, screaming wildly for a taxi. A taxi pulls to the curb. The driver looks at David, hesitates, then starts the meter and steps on the gas.<br><br>Next thing David realizes he’s bolting down the highway rehearsing what he’s going to say to Tristan. He struggles with ideas and words and feels nothing he comes up with is good enough. The taxi pulls up to the sliding, glass doors of the airport, and David vaults out.<br><br>The driver yells at him. He returns to pay him and then rushes through the automated doors into a bustling open area. He quickly regards a monitor displaying flight departures. Sees one flight leaving for New York. Rushes trough the terminal. But—<br><br>Security stops him in his tracks! Can’t pass without a boarding pass. David stares at him, trying to catch his breath as he processes everything at once. He tries to explain his situation, but the brute won’t budge, not even an inch.<br><br>David turns back and rushes to the check-in counter. He buys a business class ticket on the plane to New York. Then he runs back and passes through security.<br><br>He runs faster and faster and he’s nearly there. He’s going to do this. He’s really going to do this! Suddenly, he smashes into an older man carting luggage who looks like his father with his salt and pepper hair and chiseled jaw. He tumbles over the ground as fear hits him like a fist, knocking the breath out of him for a moment.<br><br>Just a moment.<br><br>In the chaos, he notices Tristan’s note on the ground. He grabs it. Holds it. Remembers. The man yells at David to be careful, but that’s the last thing David wants to do right now as he puts the note back into his pocket and clambers over a pile of luggage and charges away.<br><br>Within moments, he sees the gate. Sees Tristan—<br><br>Laughing with his partner.<br><br>Happy.<br><br>He freezes in his tracks. Guilt smashes down on him like a brick wall, pushing and squeezing his insides into something awful. At once everything begins to spin as he realizes—<br><br>He’s going to be sick!<br><br>David turns on his heels, rushes to the bathroom with a hand over his mouth, and blasts through a stall to purge his stomach. Then he hobbles out and washes gunk off his face and feels like the most selfish person in the world. His busted and swollen face sags with the sudden realization that if he loves Tristan… if he truly loves Tristan… he will let him go.<br><br>Rik got into his head, and he’s drunk. That’s all this is about. All he needs to do right now is be happy for Tristan. To be happy for him and go home and sleep this crazy night off."
MEMORY 392,Tome11_02,"David walks away from Gate 72 with his head in a whirlwind. He knows he isn't thinking straight and that it’s selfish to pull Tristan back into his mess. He made his bed, and now he has to fuckin' lie in it.<br><br>David approaches the security gate, and his heart clenches like a vice. It’s impossible to move. Something bigger than his doubt, his guilt and his fear won't allow him to take another step.<br><br>His hand plunges into his pocket, and he turns the note over and over. Then, in a blazing flash, details of their struggle come back to him.<br><br>How could he let him go? The one whose voice was the only peace he had ever known, whose laugh was the only joy he had ever experienced, whose every breath filled him with life and whose every word challenged him to be a better man.<br><br>How could he leave without even trying? Without showing him that he was—in the end—willing to do whatever it took for what they had.<br><br>David realizes that if he doesn’t seize this moment he’ll never know, and the regret alone would destroy him. Tristan doesn’t just make him whole, he makes him real, and no one has ever had that effect on him. Suddenly—<br><br>He comes alive.<br><br>And turns.<br><br>And fuckin' runs!<br><br>I don’t know what I’ll say… but I’ll say something… anything… I’ll say whatever comes to mind… maybe… maybe those three words from his favorite movie…<br><br>Energy charges through David like a bolt of lightning, making him faster, stronger, and somewhat confident even though he has no idea what he’s going to say or do. He just runs, and his run becomes a stumbling sprint as he sees Tristan with his partner—<br><br>About to board!<br><br>His mouth opens in a silent scream as he stumbles and falls on his face.<br><br>David… Is that you?<br><br>Tristan grabs David’s hand and helps him to his feet.<br><br>David straightens himself, and tries to look presentable despite the busted face and the mingled odor of ale, gunk and cologne. He smells like someone puked on a bed of flowers, and he knows it.<br><br>But he forgets how he looks and smells as he tries to stop his hands from shaking. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and calms himself. Then he reaches out and holds Tristan’s hands firmly. Words thicken like cement in his throat and nothing clever or poetic comes to mind. He tries to remember the line from the movie without success.<br><br>Tristan’s partner steps forward, but Tristan gestures for him to be patient as he pulls David aside.<br><br>What’s wrong, David? What the hell happened to you?<br><br>David wants to tell Tristan he means the world to him. He wants to say, I love you. But instead, he says—<br><br>No more bullshit.<br><br>Tristan mimes the words slowly, trying to understand.<br><br>David says them in a whisper, again and again, as he desperately waits for Tristan to say something, anything. Tristan says nothing, but his eyes mist, and he suddenly looks happy and sad and very confused at the same time."
Year Seven. Day 189. Morning.,Tome11_03,"Through the endless reaches of this dark, dimension we have made an astonishing discovery. A tower like a lighthouse in a thick ocean of fog calling out to us with music. Several of us recognized the melody and rushed through the fog to find the tower abandoned by its past occupants."
Year Seven. Day 189. Afternoon.,Tome11_03,I still don’t have a clear picture of who lived in this tower before other than they enjoyed golf and whiskey and kept extensive journals of people trapped in this dimension.
Year Seven. Day 189. Night.,Tome11_03,"Some are calling our temporary home Chateau Arkham, others are calling it the Arkham Hotel and the scriptwriter, James Rich, insists on calling it the House of Arkham as it reminds him of a dime comic he once read based on a story by Lovecraft. We cleared the rooms, and I took possession of the study where I found vinyl records and cassettes with stories and journals read by the previous occupant. The Chateau, my preferred name, has items and technology from other worlds that are quite difficult to understand. There is one contraption in the basement completely on the fritz. It emanates blue energy, and it seems to be manifesting memories from the atmosphere. I’ve ordered the basement off-limits until we know more."
Year Seven. Day 189. Postscript.,Tome11_03,A few of us read stories and drank a little whiskey before retiring to bed. Good stuff. Helps take the edge off.
James Rich. Journal of a Moving Picture. Of dreams and madness.,Tome11_03,"I have attempted to prepare a quick outline of what this story will be and I’m starting to sense I will need to disregard the formula for the previous pictures I’ve written and attempt something new. The truth is… I can’t make sense of any of it… It’s like living in a world of boundless imagination where everything and anything can happen. That is to say, being led to this tower feels as impossible as all the faces and residual memories we’ve been seeing in the endless fog that seems to imprison and torment us. You can bet your last dollar that if you walk in this fog long enough, you’ll bump into Lovecraft in a straitjacket convulsing on the ground, dreaming up all this impossible horror and that all that I am and all that I’ll ever be is just a figment of his madness. It’s a strange thought. I’ve mentioned the idea to several others, and they agree this tower does have the feel of a house or hotel you would find in his fictional town of Arkham. Several in the group began calling the tower the ‘Arkham Inn.’ But I still maintain the more fitting name is ‘House of Arkham.’"
MEMORY 1721,Tome12_01,"Talbot opens his eyes in a daze, sitting in a wooden chair, slowly returning from a journey half-remembered. He remembers the flowers and luminous colors. Blue and purple. Glowing and dripping with strange nectar-like fluid. The strange blue and purple flowers from another world. He heaves a groggy sigh and isn’t sure if he travelled at the speed of thought to defy time and experience a moment from the future or…<br><br>…if it was all some elaborate fantasy put together by his imagination with an unremembered assortment of past memories. Either way, it felt real and that for the time being was enough.<br><br>Talbot glances at the poppy in his hand. Incredible how a flower, a single flower can take you on such a journey through realms within and possible realms without—through realms unknown.<br><br>You’re back, Mr. Grimes!<br><br>Talbot turns with a start to face Junius, an investor in The Company. He despised everything about this man. How he presented himself in his black suit and waxed moustache. How he looked at him. How he had to justify everything he wanted to do with him and his brethren in terms of profit.<br><br>What are you doing here?<br><br>We need your, how shall I say, expertise to help us collect samples in a remote location in Northern Africa.<br><br>I’m afraid I’m on another assignment. But I’m sure you’re able to send in the other chemists.<br><br>We have.<br><br>And?<br><br>They disappeared along with several other expeditions we’ve sent in.<br><br>Talbot turned away, taking in a basement filled with black smoke and the drowsy scent of opium, urine, sweat and vomit. The den was lined with two rows of straw-mattress beds accompanied by little tables with nut-oil lamps to heat up the opium before placing it into a pipe as long as a rifle.<br><br>Men groan and grin with their eyes shut. One man stares at Talbot and laughs slowly and heavily with a pipe to his lips. Every time he pulls at the burning opium pellet there is a hellish frying sound.<br><br>Junius clears his throat. Understand, Mr. Grimes, there is no assignment more critical for The Company than this one.<br><br>And by critical, Talbot understands he means, profitable."
MEMORY 1730,Tome12_01,"Luminous blue droplets drip from a canopy of blooming flowers. A petal falls and he tracks its movement and catches it in mid-air. He examines the round shape, smooth texture and places it in a vial. Then he grabs another vial and begins to catch droplets of this otherworldly fluid, wondering if like the poppy it could open doorways within the mind. A strangled gasp suddenly breaks the almost palpable silence. He searches the small twisted trees and shrubs and soon finds Oswald with his back against a boulder, sucking in quick shallow breaths, covering a wound in his stomach with his hand. He looks up at Talbot.<br><br>Quick, please… It’s coming back for me.<br><br>Talbot is torn between helping him and moving on.<br><br>What is? What’s coming for you? What did this to you?<br><br>Talbot takes a shuddering breath and kneels beside Oswald, opening his satchel and searching for thread to stitch him up.<br><br>It’s hunting us… the man-beast. Nothing hurts it… Nothing… I shot it, cut it, stabbed it and it continued after me...<br><br>Save your strength.<br><br>I found the others. They’re alive… this thing… it's making something with them.<br><br>Talbot retrieves the thread and begins to stich up the gash. He turns to the satchel and his eyes take in the luminous blue fluid he collected from the vines and flowers. He’s not sure what it does, and he knows it will be a while before he does.<br><br>Talbot stares at Oswald. He can’t do it. He shouldn’t do it. And yet, this is an emergency. He must do what he can to help him even if it means taking a chance on an untested serum.<br><br>He almost has no choice.<br><br>He hesitates, then grabs the vial and stares at it. He knows he’s lying to himself. He knows there are other ways to help him. But he also knows The Company hasn’t officially accepted his proposal for human experimentation. Human experimentation could take a long time, a real long time, and he doesn’t have a long time. It might be years before he gets another chance like this. He could administer a drop… just a drop… and see what medicinal properties the nectar-like secretion may or may not have.<br><br>The secretion is a gift from another world. Last thing he wants is to spend years staring at the vial collecting dust on a wooden shelf in his laboratory while The Company debates the merits of his proposal. In fact, they’ll be grateful he took the initiative.<br><br>Slowly, he lowers the vial to the wound. He tilts the lip slightly and lets a tiny drop slip out into the sticky wound. He waits for his blood to absorb the secretion and watches ever closely.<br><br>At first nothing seems to happen. Then all at once Oswald’s face twists in horror as his body warps. A fiery blue light burns through him as blue and purple sacks begin to cover his body.<br><br>Talbot stares, amazed. He’s never seen anything like it. It’s incredible. One drop shocked his entire system within a few minutes. The mutation and energy release alone seemed impossible. And yet… there it was… right in front of him.<br><br>Oswald screams as one boil after another erupts with purple puss.<br><br>Amazement turns to fear as Talbot stares at the ghastly sight and realizes what he’s done to the cook. His mind searches desperately for ways to help the poor man but there’s nothing he can do. Over the screams he hears Ena’s disembodied voice echoing behind him.<br><br>Talbot, dear, what have you done? What have you done!<br><br>Talbot scrambles back on his heels, then turns and charges through the madness of this impossible world with a maelstrom of conflicting emotions rushing through him.<br><br>What have I done? What have I done!<br><br>Talbot shambles through thick vines and clambers over rocks and corpses blooming with luminous flowers. He tumbles to the ground and tells himself it was for the greater good. That the cook was probably going to die anyway. That he’s doing something important. That he’s searching for chemicals and compounds potent enough to transport people to other worlds at the speed of thought.<br><br>The speed of thought is the only way to travel between worlds, and the doors to these unseen and unknown worlds are within… and any effort in trying to find those keys far outweigh the life of a cook.<br><br>Desperately, he clambers to his feet and finds himself surrounded by a living mass of black fog. He stares at it intently and his panicking mind calms with amazement as he finds himself staring at tiny cells that undulate together like some sort of vaporous membrane. Then—<br><br>The fog slowly dissipates to reveal a tree covered in thick black leaves.<br><br>Talbot stares at the tree and begins to notice the trunk writhing and realizes it made of people. He realizes in amazement that he has found the missing employees. He begins a slow march toward this tree of death with his eyes wide and his jaw hanging. It’s beautiful and horrific at the same time. It’s…<br><br>Sublime.<br><br>It’s the only word that comes to mind.<br><br>As Talbot approaches the gnarled tree, the black leaves suddenly take flight, revealing themselves to be massive crows. He gazes skyward and watches the crows disappear into the darkness. Then he hears the crunch of stone and quickly lowers his gaze to find himself face to face with the man-beast.<br><br>The creature stares at Talbot with a gaping mouth and glowing blue eyes as though recognizing him. It hesitates and seems conflicted as it peers into his disbelieving eyes. Suddenly—<br><br>The creature shrieks something horrible and vines burst out of its hands and wrap around his chest squeezing the breath out of him until he slowly drifts into nothingness.<br><br>With a gasp, Talbot opens his eyes alone in the desert under a blistering sun with no sense of the passage of time. He remembers pulling himself off the tree. He remembers someone crying out to him for help. He remembers taking samples as everything evaporated before his eyes. Then he remembers walking and collapsing under a scorching white sun, wondering if he was going to suddenly wake up in another world or, perhaps, in an opium den.<br><br>Talbot struggles to sit up as a mirage of men on camels gallop toward him. He looks down to his clenched fist, opening it slowly to reveal a blue and purple flower."
MEMORY 1722,Tome12_01,"Junius hadn’t been exactly right. There had been a chemist who had returned from the expedition, an old friend and rival from school, Tomas. Tomas had returned from his journey into the Bleed—as Junius called it—without uttering a single word about anything he had seen or experienced. In fact, he hadn’t uttered a single word since his return. And as Junius explains how he hopes an old friend would stimulate Tomas, he marches along the grimy London road, leading Talbot to Tomas’ home. Within minutes they approach the entrance of a modest dwelling and Junius knocks hard. A doctor opens the door and greets them both, explaining how Tomas has gone to pieces and that no one can get anything out of him. The doctor then leads them to a small, dank room where Talbot’s old school friend sits at the edge of a bed, rocking nervously. A candle on a nearby table illuminates him in the darkness.<br><br>With slow steps Talbot approaches Tomas, horrified by the haggard face and the empty eyes staring up at him. He proceeds to sit on a stool beside him.<br><br>My dear old friend… I only heard a few days ago you were back from quite an assignment as I have been made to understand.<br><br>Tomas doesn’t answer but his eyes brim with sudden tears.<br><br>It’s okay. You can tell me what happened.<br><br>Tomas tries to speak but only mumbles incoherently. After a moment, a tear slips down his pale cheek and he manages to point a trembling finger at a cabinet.<br><br>Talbot stands, brushes past Junius, and grabs a leather satchel. He opens it and pulls out a journal, and shows it to Tomas. Tomas nods and struggles to speak but his eyes suddenly widen and instead of words, he releases a hellish scream that grows louder and louder with every breath.<br><br>Panicked, the doctor rushes in, quickly escorting them out of the room as Talbot gives his friend one last, trailing look and wonders what could have broken such a stoic and brilliant mind."
MEMORY 1723,Tome12_01,"Talbot sits in a horse-drawn carriage reading the notebooks. Nothing but gibberish and the disturbing thoughts of a chemist losing his mind. If he were to believe the notebooks, Tomas had lived an eternity in a world where people were constantly hunted like game by apparitions pulled out of dark folk tales. He had only disappeared a week and yet there were hundreds of entries. Perhaps, thousands. It made little to no sense. Neither did Junius. He had misjudged the money-man. He was a lot more compassionate than he had anticipated, and he seemed to express genuine sympathy for Tomas.<br><br>Despite being obsessed with profit, he is really quite human.<br><br>It dawns on Talbot that Junius might in fact be two people and that The Company does a strange thing to him, acting almost like a catalyst. He seems to be different when representing The Company. It seems as though The Company affords him something which allows him to be someone else.<br><br>Someone else, entirely.<br><br>Perhaps, protection.<br><br>Perhaps, anonymity.<br><br>Perhaps, both.<br><br>Talbot suspects the same may be said of him with his pursuits. But somehow he’s sure that even with the protection and anonymity of The Company he manages to retain his compassion for others. And yet… he goes through his friend’s notebooks less from a position of grief and more from a position of curiosity. He wonders if this objective disposition makes him less human, or perhaps… more human.<br><br>Any beast can react in anger or rage or grief. What sets us apart from animals is our intellect, our ability to stand above our emotions for the greater good. And yet…<br><br>…Talbot cannot help but entertain the thought that what sets humans apart from machines is our emotions. No. Not emotions. Our empathy. Our ability to feel what others feel just by imagining what they might be going through… what they might be suffering. That is an ability above and beyond the simple mechanisms of the intellect.<br><br>What an incredible power it is to be able to put ourselves in another person’s shoes. It’s why theatre and poetry and stories can even exist. Without empathy the human experience would have to be redefined as something else… something smaller… something closer to that of an insect.<br><br>And yet…<br><br>…It’s the empathy variable that seems to be the great obstacle to achieving true objectivity. To achieving truth. But what’s the use of true objectivity, if it means losing one’s humanity."
MEMORY 1724,Tome12_01,"Talbot isn’t sure how long he’s been in this small dinghy up the river under a scorching, white African sun with an escort of soldiers. Company soldiers. The Company’s so big it has one of the largest mercenary forces in the world. Impressive, really, and secretly, he admires the fact that they do what they want when they want without consequence or fear of tarnishing the reputation of King and country. He stares at the soldiers as they lounge about the stern. Young, callous men who found a place to hunt, kill and torture human beings with anonymity. The cook, Oswald, talks about rebellions he’s put down in various colonies as well as the wonderful dishes he’s discovered from other lands. Calder is a known tracker who’s captured several dissidents and showed us a collection of severed ears he took from the scoundrels. Dallin fills the silences with stories about his fiancée. She’s beautiful and fun and from a good family and Talbot senses he speaks aloud more to convince himself about his affections for her than anyone else. He’s torn between her and his love of soldiering and somehow understands he can’t have both. She’ll ask him too many questions, make him think about things he’d rather not think about, and remind him of his better self.<br><br>Talbot knows the feeling all too well. He was in love once, too. Ena. But his love for her wasn’t enough. At least not enough for him to turn his back on his experiments. She was jealous of his work—of his lab. All the time he spent there. All the energy and thought he gave his experiments.<br><br>When Ena smashed the lab to pieces and set it ablaze, he immediately understood how much she loved him, and seeing his destroyed lab, he immediately felt the pain and misery he was causing her. And he didn’t want to experience those feelings anymore. Or the guilt."
MEMORY 1725,Tome12_01,"Riding a camel under a blistering sun, Talbot wipes beads of sweat from his brow and follows Calder and the other soldiers to a sprawling camp of tents covered in sand. They quickly halt as a man in desert attire approaches them, introducing himself as Farley. Talbot dismounts and they exchange pleasantries. Then Talbot follows Farley across the camp, past countless cooking fires surrounded by whispering, company men and into the largest tent.<br><br>Farley turns to Talbot. I would like to say that all this is not… how should I put it… conventional. What I share with you must never be spoken of with anyone else.<br><br>Talbot nods slightly.<br><br>Farley walks over to the back of the tent and lifts a flap to reveal a huge mass of black fog in the distance. Strange purple and blue light emanates from within.<br><br>What is that? What am I looking at?<br><br>Farley stares at the mass of fog. We refer to it as the Bleed. A theory put forward is that it could be another dimension… how should I say… spilling into our own. We have seen and noted these phenomena before, but never for this long. Never long enough to explore. We need you to enter, take notes and collect samples of flora and fauna should you find any.<br><br>Talbot peers intently at the barrier of fog.<br><br>You believe this to be another dimension?<br><br>We don’t know what to think, and that is precisely why we sent for you, Mr. Grimes.<br><br>You could have chosen more experienced chemists. There are several—<br><br>We did. They never returned, and we are certainly concerned for their well-being. But if you could find a way to collect and bring back samples from this anomaly their sacrifice would not have been in vain.<br><br>Talbot furrows his brow.<br><br>Farley sighs, closes the flap, and faces Talbot. We would even consider your proposal to improve… how should I say… the quality of your experiments. That is to say, we could certainly find a way to give you access to the test subjects you desire.<br><br>The King would have our heads.<br><br>My dear Mr. Grimes… we do not answer to the King."
MEMORY 1726,Tome12_01,"We do not answer to the King. Talbot considers the implications of those words over and over again as he prepares his leather satchel with his notebook, tools and vials. He then closes the satchel and wonders who in fact The Company answers to if not the King. Junius had once told him The Company was like a person and was given the same respect as a person. And yet, The Company didn’t seem like a person. It seemed like something else. Something different. Something, perhaps, like a beast… a beast pretending to be a person. A dark thing unleashed into the world to destroy and plunder and return to its masters with a mouthful of death and a fistful of gold. A part of Talbot hated being a part of this dark thing for the longest time. But over the years he had found a way to rise above his guilt and admire the sheer power and brilliance of what it could do in the world and what it could achieve for its masters without reproach.<br><br>When the beast became a problem, the masters could simply end its life abruptly, burying the beast and all the pain, death and horror it had caused in a forgotten grave. But not the gold. Not the plunder. They, the masters, could keep it all. Keep the gold and the plunder and eventually use it to inject life into a new beast or, perhaps, beasts. The Company may not have been a person, but it was certainly a form of life. And gold was its life-force. Its blood.<br><br>Talbot suddenly feels inspired. Gold is energy. No. Not gold. Currency. Currency is energy. No. Not energy. A variable to direct and control people. To manipulate the fold. Yes. There is something worth exploring in the thought. Something worth pursuing. Something that could help The Company and its masters. He asks himself if there is a way to understand people in reduced terms—in terms of energy and equations.<br><br>Talbot quickly pulls out his notebook and jots down a concept: Fold Energy. He scribbles down an equation, crosses it out, then rewrites another version. He examines the equation, then releases a sigh and crosses it out again. He wonders for a long moment if people could actually be reduced to a chemical equation that could somehow determine output and potential.<br><br>It was a strange idea. Perhaps even an awful idea. And yet this idea had legs—legs like a beast. It was certainly plausible to treat people as a kind of energy that could be contained and controlled except for one variable—the human variable.<br><br>Empathy.<br><br>The strength of currency as a variable to control, manipulate and predict energy flow would be directly proportional to the value people placed on currency in their lives. But… there had to be ways to remove or reduce the human variable. To somehow turn currency into a collective god, or, in the very least, a demi-god. Something the fold feared, prayed to, and constantly meditated on. One single god to control them all. One single variable to stimulate, shock, and direct Fold Energy.<br><br>Talbot stares at his notebook and laughs to himself. The idea is ludicrous! There are no legs! There’s no present or future world where he or anyone else could experiment on eliminating the human variable. Such a thing not even The Company could get away with. But if it could…<br><br>…If it could…<br><br>...It would be far more powerful and effective at controlling the fold than any King or Empire.<br><br>Talbot scratches out his equations, realizing they are nothing more than highly imaginative scribbles masquerading as science. Even if The Company were granted the ability to experiment on the fold without limits he could not imagine how this intangible human variable could be reduced let alone removed from the equation. All the cultures and communities and diverging beliefs and values would never allow such a god or demi-god to exist.<br><br>Shaking his head at the absurdity of his theory, Talbot closes his notebook, places it in his satchel and prepares for the journey to come."
MEMORY 1727,Tome12_01,"Talbot leads his retinue toward a wall of fog, ignoring the gasps and sighs behind him. He stops in his tracks just before entering. Oswald announces that he thinks they should all turn back and that if they do he’ll make them a wonderful dish he learned in India. Calder says the money they are paying him makes turning back impossible. Dallin agrees with Calder. Talbot takes note of the comment, then extends a finger and pokes the almost liquid fog, and the fog extends a tendril and pokes him back. In disbelief Talbot pokes the fog again to see if he’ll stimulate a similar response.<br><br>But the fog doesn’t poke back.<br><br>The first time was possibly just a reaction to their collective body heat. The thought of conscious mist or fog almost seems absurd. He stares at the fog for a long moment then hears Ena’s voice calling out his name from within the Bleed. He sighs, ignores the voice, and for a moment regrets the swig of laudanum he took to calm his heart and focus his thoughts. Then, as the men continue to gasp and whisper concerns about the fog, Talbot closes his eyes and takes one small step into the unknown."
MEMORY 1728,Tome12_01,"Talbot opens his eyes to find himself staring at strange luminous blue and purple vines attached to volcanic rock formations he strangely recognizes. Large crows he barely recognize circle and caw in the dark sky. Two company soldiers step up beside him with their eyes wide with disbelief.<br><br>Talbot turns to Calder and Oswald. He scrutinizes the passage of fog behind them, waiting for Dallin to push through. Where’s your friend?<br><br>Calder and Oswald realize they lost Dallin and proceed to wave the fog and call out his name. Then Calder moves into the fog, but Talbot grabs his shoulder, stopping him. We are not where we think we are?<br><br>Calder pulls away from Talbot. I’m not sure what that’s supposed to mean?<br><br>We can’t just leave him?<br><br>Talbot approaches the fog separating them from the camp. My thoughts are that he turned and returned to camp.<br><br>Calder and Oswald exchange a look with Talbot. Then Calder steps forward and leads them into the blue and purple gloom.<br><br>They soon approach a wall of vines with a luminous blue nectar-like substance flowing through veins blocking their path. Talbot reaches up and gently pulls a petal from small a flower and places it in a vial.<br><br>Calder withdraws a machete with a high-pitch ring and the vines seem to suddenly tremble.<br><br>Talbot senses something amiss and grabs Calder’s arm mid-swing.<br><br>Not the best idea.<br><br>Nonsense.<br><br>Calder yanks his arm free and savagely cuts a path through the vines as a purple substance splatters all over him.<br><br>Instantly the butchered vines shrivel up and disintegrate like embers into small puffs of fog. Talbot watches with his mouth hanging as the other vines seem to retract from Calder as though conscious of his lethal intentions. They seem to be retreating from a threat.<br><br>Calder nudges Talbot and gestures for him to snap out of his trance. But as he takes a step forward the volcanic rock below his feet suddenly crack open, black fog spews out, and a thick vine slithers out and touches Calder’s boot.<br><br>Before Talbot can stop him, Calder stamps the vine like a snake. He laughs and shakes his head as the vine snaps alive, wraps around his ankle and rips his leg off with impossible power. A fountain of hot arterial blood sprays the cold darkness as Calder screams in agony.<br><br>Talbot swallows hard as Oswald panics to help the tracker. He moves past the screaming man and stares at the retreating vines with mingled curiosity and disbelief.<br><br>It might be that this other realm is very much conscious. A living realm analyzing and testing them. To what purpose, he isn’t sure. But—<br><br>Screams suddenly interrupt Talbot’s thoughts. He turns on Calder and suppresses an impulse to yell at him. He’s likely in excruciating pain and didn’t mean the interruption. He quickly puts on an expression of concern and kneels by his trembling body, wondering how long a person can live without a leg.<br><br>Oswald cries that they should take him back to camp. But Talbot’s unwilling to compromise his one opportunity to observe and study what no chemist has ever observed or studied before. Yet he doesn’t want to waste time arguing with Oswald. He simply wouldn’t understand. He tells Oswald he needs to dress Calder’s wounds before they can carry him back to camp.<br><br>Oswald nods agreement as Talbot withdraws a bottle of laudanum, his concoction, a mixture more powerful than anything any company has ever produced. He places the bottle to Calder’s lips, tells him the serum will ease the pain, and he proceeds to pour the contents down his trembling mouth.<br><br>Within moments, Calder stops shaking and his eyes roll back as he issues his last breath. Talbot allows a small grin and he suddenly feels the barrel of a pistol at the base of his head.<br><br>What did you do to my friend?<br><br>Talbot closes his eyes and waits for death."
MEMORY 1729,Tome12_01,"Oswald shouts at Talbot, calling him a bloody murderer. As his finger curls around the trigger, a massive cloud of fog rushes up to him and grabs him like a fist and pulls him—kicking and screaming—into the darkness. Talbot stands on shaking legs staring at the scene incredulously. It was as though this realm was protecting him. It was as though it was keeping him alive for some unknown reason. He felt a sudden pang of guilt for Calder and Oswald, then it was gone, and he began to follow the spiraling path of jagged rock illuminated by luminous vines and flowers. He followed it for a long while when he heard her voice again. It couldn’t be. Ena. He stopped, turned round and round, searching desperately. This time he was sure it wasn’t the laudanum. It was this place. It wasn’t protecting him. It was… messing with him… playing with him like a cat does a mouse. He closes his eyes, covers his ears and continues to follow the spiraling purple path."
MEMORY 201,Tome12_02,"Pedestrians crowd the rainy streets of White Rock, Colorado. A couple exits a grocery store just as Jonah charges into them, knocking them down, spilling apples and oranges into shimmering puddles. Street lights illuminate Jonah as he shouts a quick apology and runs into the street. A horn blares. Headlights flash. Jonah slides over the hood of a yellow sedan into the path of a cyclist, knocking her down. She clambers to her feet shouting at him as bullets whip through the air.<br><br>Glancing over his shoulder, Jonah hard charges through a souvenir shop—breaking mugs and plates—and vaults through the back exit and into an alley, slipping on wet pavement. He springs to his feet and sprints away.<br><br>Clearing a fence, he leaps, tumbles down a concrete embankment and quickly scrambles to hide behind a collection of garbage bins. As he catches his breath, two assailants in black trench coats rush by him, holding gleaming pistols with silencers.<br><br>Jonah squints into the darkness after them realizing someone wasn’t too happy he decoded their seemingly random sounds broadcast from unknown locations. Spies, he imagines, sending names and coordinates through encrypted signals and pulses for reasons he still hasn’t puzzled out.<br><br>But his superiors pulled him off fast when he had managed to decrypt names of corporations and prominent billionaires. They pulled him off a bit too fast. And so he thought he’d investigate on his own. Not the best idea he'd ever had. But something in him had to know. Had to understand why he was ordered to stay away from these cryptic messages that contained the name of people who would sometimes disappear. To him this seemed somehow related to human trafficking. But Dean…<br><br>…Dean didn’t fit the pattern. He wasn’t like the others who had disappeared. He was loud and outspoken and blaming the government for everything that had happened to his students.<br><br>He needed to find the high school teacher before these henchmen did."
MEMORY 210,Tome12_02,"Ten lies to hide one truth. It’s certainly possible. And it certainly sounds like something the agency would have done in its formative years when mandates were hazy and departments were run by psychopaths like Stamper and Carter. All those secret departments and experiments that had destroyed so many lives had been officially shut down. But… unofficially… he could not say for certain.<br><br>Unofficially, the programs could have moved to other branches of the government, or they could have been rebranded within the manifold compartments of the agency. He couldn’t know. Not for certain.<br><br>With a sigh Jonah gives up his futile search for something that would corroborate the teacher’s story. He jumps on the hood of a gutted truck, lying on his back, staring at the stars with a terrible feeling rising from the pit of his stomach. He’s never going to see the teacher again. Nor will anyone else. The teacher’s gone. He’d never know the truth unless he bought some equipment and climbed up to the station to see for himself.<br><br>Part of him wants to go home and just forget this whole ordeal. Another part of him wants to know. Needs to know. Needs to understand why he was pulled off the assignment so abruptly. The left hand didn’t realize what the right hand was doing and panicked. That panic had caused a strange feeling inside of him. That very same feeling was there again as when buried rumors of the agency creating and funding rebels to destabilize regions and sell weapons to governments began to resurface.<br><br>The mere thought makes him want to quit and join his father on the farm. But he’s never quit a thing in his life, and he can’t help but see how perfectly positioned he is to weed the garden from within. Perhaps even kill a few snakes while he’s at it. Seems to him quitting would only allow the weeds to grow and the snakes to reign. He couldn’t allow that, and he certainly couldn’t turn his back on his country even if it meant living a double life. It’s what he was doing anyway. The more he thought about it the more he realized he was in for the climb of his life. Perhaps even… the fight of his life."
MEMORY 202,Tome12_02,"Screams reverberate from his cellphone as Jonah sits in his small, grimy motel room. He watches the fake footage created by a few teens in the area. The screen fills with teens running from an abandoned station as fog rolls after them with deadly hooks like talons trying to snatch them. He has no idea what he’s looking at. Looks like the paintings he had once seen in the Fresno museum with his mother when he was just a kid. Art would broaden his horizons, she had said. Not this art. This art scared the shit out of him. He never wanted to go to another museum again after that. Dean Barker was their teacher. His name was encrypted in the signals because he knows something. His students definitely told him something. Jonah closes the video and opens Dean’s digital profile hoping for a clue—any clue—to find him."
MEMORY 203,Tome12_02,"Satellite facial recognition pictures in Dean’s digital profile shows Jonah that the teacher often visits a community of homeless men and women carving out a meager existence under a busy overpass. He disembarks his car, walks down, and weaves through the small campfires, searching the cold, solemn faces illuminated by flicking orange light. After some time, he sees a man covered in blankets staring at him intently. As Jonah approaches the man, he jolts to his feet and charges away. Jonah sprints after him to the edge of the highway where he watches Dean sprint past oncoming cars and disappear into the woods on the other side. With a heavy sigh, he returns to his car, trying to catch his breath, wondering what the hell this high school teacher knows that’s got him so spooked."
MEMORY 204,Tome12_02,"In the early morning Jonah sits in his car surveying a nursing home, hoping Dean will try to reach out to his father. He unexpectedly sighs with the realization that he hasn’t contacted his parents for at least three weeks and they’re probably worried sick about him. He’s a fool, and he knows it. You don’t do that to the ones who loved, raised and protected you for the better part of your life. He feels like a spoiled, ungrateful, entitled brat for letting so much time pass without taking one moment—just one moment in his day—to connect with them.<br><br>Jonah stares at the entrance of the nursing home, telling himself he’ll find some time to call his parents in the evening. Dean’s father has Alzheimer’s and needs constant support. He doesn’t even want to begin to imagine a life where his parents forget him or don’t remember how proud they are that he’s using everything they instilled within him to protect and serve their country and the free world. He never admitted to them that he sometimes felt inadequate for spending most of his time behind a desk despite his superiors telling him he was the right hand of very critical operations.<br><br>The only problem is he has no idea what the left hand is doing with his work. And often Jonah feels like he’s only being presented with a half-truth.<br><br>It’s why he’s here.<br><br>It’s why he’s running his own investigation with his savings. His perfectly reasonable questions about the corporations he deciphered from the signals touched a nerve. A major nerve. It was a reaction even his chief officer hadn’t seen before and he was officially ordered off the assignment. And so, being a good right hand, he officially moved on to a new assignment. Unofficially though…<br><br>He had questions he needed answered."
MEMORY 205,Tome12_02,"As the sun slips below the horizon, Jonah spots a man leaving the nursing home through the side exit. Jonah disembarks and follows the man to the back of the home where he loses him. Again! He curses under his breath and feels like he has to brush up on his field work. He needs to spend a little more time running investigations than sitting behind a desk crunching numbers, searching for patterns, and talking baseball. With a sigh, he strides back to his car, tries to open the door, then realizes it’s locked. He activates the remote in his pocket, opens the door, hops in and starts the car. For a moment he leans against the steering wheel as he stares at the entrance of the nursing home frustrated with himself. He prepares to shift gears into reverse when the passenger door suddenly thrusts open and he finds himself staring at the barrel of a gun. Frustration turns to embarrassment as a hooded man jumps into the passenger seat and closes the door."
MEMORY 206,Tome12_02,"Jonah raises his hands. Dean stares at him for a long moment, then lowers the gun. Why are you following me? I said I’d come to you when it was safe.<br><br>Jonah lowers his hands. He has no idea what Dean’s talking about but he clearly thinks he’s someone he’s not. He shrugs.<br><br>You need to be more careful. If I spotted you this easily, they’ll spot you too. These people after me are highly trained, ex-military. They’re pros. You don’t see them coming before they put a bullet in your head.<br><br>Jonah saw them coming when he was searching Dean’s apartment.<br><br>How do you know I’m not one of them?<br><br>Dean swallows hard. I’d by dead by now. You still want to talk to me? It’s not too late to back away from the rabbit hole.<br><br>I do.<br><br>Drive. I’ll tell you where to go."
MEMORY 207,Tome12_02,"Dean refers to Jonah as Max, thinking he works with an independent organization investigating a series of missing persons. He directs him to a dirt road which he follows to an old decrepit wooden bridge. Jonah breaks to a stop by the woods and turns to Dean who stares blankly as the bridge in the moonlight.<br><br>Dean sighs. My father and I used to fish in the river under the bridge. We had some good times. What do you know about me, Max?<br><br>Jonah turns his gaze from him. You were a high school teacher. You quit last year after the junkyard tragedy.<br><br>That was no tragedy. I knew those kids. They didn’t bad trip and kill each other. They did a lot of stupid things but they didn’t do that.<br><br>Jonah nods attentively.<br><br>At first I thought spooks set them up, but then I realized it was much bigger than that. Aren’t you gonna take notes?<br><br>Jonah taps his temple with a finger.<br><br>I’ll remember.<br><br>Right, well… Johnny and the others picked up signals from the old abandoned station in the mountains. Weird frequencies and vibrations… And they went up to see what was going on… and when they reached the station, they filmed a bunch of maniacs in robes conducting some ancient ritual while impaling some drugged man who had no idea what was going on.<br><br>Jonah raises his eyebrows skeptically.<br><br>That was fake footage—a prank to go viral.<br><br>Dean shakes his head solemnly.<br><br>I wish it were. They’d still be alive if it were. Mocking birds embedded in the media told ten lies to hide one truth. Then they discredited and eliminated the source.<br><br>Dean was referring to an old initiative which had been shut down years before Jonah was born. Jonah sighed skeptically and would have normally dismissed this man as a conspiracy junkie except for the fact that his name was important enough to encrypt in a series of signals.<br><br>Before they were eliminated… they went up to the station again… and got more footage before those bastards destroyed the bridge to get up there. I released some of that footage and they responded… ten lies to hide one truth… and somehow I must have left a digital trail.<br><br>Dean shakes his head and stares blankly out the windshield.<br><br>The rabbit hole goes deep on this one… real deep… Our institutions have been compromised by a few idiots trying to bring a very dark thing into our world.<br><br>Jonah nods thoughtfully just as a bullet punches into the rear of the car. Without hesitation, Dean vaults out into the high grass and charges through the woods. Jonah jumps out after him."
MEMORY 208,Tome12_02,"Jonah moves stealthily through the shadows with his gun at the ready. He counted two assailants pursuing them and he figures they’re the same two who confronted him at Dean’s apartment. Seems like a lot of heat for a conspiracy junkie peddling fake footage of ancient cults and deadly rituals. Quickly he ducks in the underbrush and listens to steady footfalls growing louder and louder. He waits patiently for his pursuers. One runs past him. He lunges and knocks him unconscious with the butt of his revolver. He then slinks in the shadows and waits for the other. An instant later he sees him rushing toward him. Just as he passes he thrusts out his arm and clotheslines him. Then he quickly follows through with a pounding fist in the head. Straightening up, he calls out for Dean and, activating the light on his phone, proceeds to search for him."
MEMORY 209,Tome12_02,"Jonah pulls up to the junkyard hoping Dean has the same instinct. He disembarks, climbs over a chain-link fence and surveys the area.<br><br>Doesn’t make sense.<br><br>Something doesn’t add up.<br><br>His instinct tells him there are other possibilities. He takes a moment to clear his mind. Then he visualizes the teens arguing about what they should do next and where they should hide the evidence they’ve collected on this ancient cult. Johnny grabs an envelope and disappears amongst the piled cars.<br><br>Jonah peers at the cars and wonders if there’s something hidden in the yard. Something the police may have overlooked. He figures he’s got some time to kill before Dean shows up if someone didn’t get to him already."
Journal of a Moving Picture. The Trapper.,Tome12_03,"Listened to a few memories of a deranged miner named Evan on the phonograph. In a nearby pile of discarded stories I even found comic books inspired by the very same memories. Seems to me that these comics were created by artists and authors in other worlds who somehow dreamed of this maniac and his crimes. True in one world, fiction in another, and, I suppose, vice versa. Makes me wonder if someone in another world is dreaming and writing about us."
Year Seven. Day 207. Night.,Tome12_03,"Life here is an unrelenting struggle against alienation, anxiety, depression and boredom. The mini-putt helps. The stories, too. We all take turns reading them. James takes it to another level and performs them. Before he was a writer, he was an actor who had worked on several radio serials and advertisements. With all these distractions, it’s nice to forget the horrors of this world and the hard fight to maintain our sanity."
Twelve to Midnight. The Crows.,Tome12_03,"The farmhouse sat at the end of a long, serpentine dirt road in the middle of nowhere. The derelict house at the end of the road had a roof that sagged and a warped, wide-covered deck with birdfeeders that hadn’t been filled in years. The vast cornfields surrounding the farm house were wild and rumpled. A chime dangling from a nearby gnarled tree rang softly in the warm, humid wind as Max Holt, sitting on a hill at a distance, used binoculars to examine the barns, the rusting tractors and an old collapsing outhouse. Just beyond the farm, he noticed a cemetery with gravestones, etched black against the dusk. He sighed, lowered the binoculars and wiped beads of sweat off his brow.<br><br>“So why exactly am I in Texas?” He asked, adjusting a small device in his ear. “What’s so special about this abandoned farm?”<br><br>“It’s not abandoned… We decoded a name two days ago and tracked him here.” Haddie’s voice emerged through the tiny black, communication device in his ear.<br><br>“What do we know about the mark?”<br><br>“Tom Smith. Born in Nevada. Worked as a creative manager in the 60s and 70s in South America for several multinational corporations. No citations. No tickets. No fines. Always paid his taxes on time. Perfect record.”<br><br>“Sounds like a cover.”<br><br>“Good observation. His real name is Luis Rand. Born in Oakland. Film degree from UCLA. Recruited by the government for a special department. Luis ended up in charge of manufacturing rebellion. Meaning, he produced fictional radio broadcasts in several countries reporting on the victories of rebels that never existed.”<br><br>“Why go through all that trouble?”<br><br>“People don’t act if they’ve lost hope.”<br><br>“What year are we talking about?”<br><br>“1950s. Luis created fictional rebel groups to revolt against a government that was trying to do some good for its people. Each broadcast reported a growing rebellion marching on the capital to depose of the president. Usual fare… lies, terror, propaganda… fabrications designed to make the rebels seem unbeatable so no one would dare oppose them. The agency created a boogeyman that never existed, and they used that boogeyman to overthrow an elected president trying to do some good for his country.”<br><br>“Right,” Max said. “And heard they’re working on a sequel to the original ‘War of the Worlds.’ Looking forward to that, myself. Heard it’s an epic Five Eyes co-production with no expenses spared.” He chuckled as he scanned the vast empty fields behind the farm. “Should I be looking out for mutilated cows or scorched geometric shapes in cornfields?”<br><br>“Not funny, Max. These operations corrupted, destabilized and destroyed entire countries, and Luis has information the Vale wants. You need to get to him before they do.”<br><br>Suddenly, Max heard a rumbling in the distance. His binoculars swiveled to a black SUV thundering down the dirt road, throwing great clouds of dust in the air. “Shit, we might be too late. I’ve got an SUV approaching fast.” He hooked his binoculars to his belt and withdrew his pistol. “I’m heading in.”<br><br>“Watch yourself.”<br><br>“Always.”<br><br><br><br>MAX RUSHED DOWN THE HILL as the SUV came to a stop and three shadowy figures vaulted out. Two agents kicked the front door and charged into the house while the other stood guard outside. As Max approached the entrance he lowered to a stealthy crab-walk. From inside he suddenly heard someone cry out in pain. They had Luis and were preparing to torture him. He had to move fast.<br><br>With a great sense of urgency, Max inched closer to the guard, concealing himself in the shadows. Then, all at once, he sprung up behind him, took him in a chokehold and squeezed until his torso shook and his legs sagged.<br><br>Carefully, Max lowered the unconscious agent to the ground as Luis released another scream. They had begun to interrogate him. He didn’t have much time.<br><br>Max followed the edge of the house to an open window and climbed inside the cluttered home and nearly slipped on a counter covered in grime and dead flies. Stacks of dirty dishes covered the kitchen table. Piles of magazines and books rose from the floor to the ceiling. On the walls were black and white surveillance photos of artists painting murals and protesting various dictators that had been selected and sponsored by the agency.<br><br>Max picked his way into the hallway, moving slowly toward the sound of hard knuckles hitting swollen flesh accompanied by the occasional groan. He froze suddenly when everything stopped and one of the agents spoke. “Where are the letters? Where are The Crows? Who else knows about them?”<br><br>Luis didn’t answer.<br><br>The punches and groans continued, and so did Max. He inched slowly toward the living room, picking his way around the stacks of boxes and crates, stopping with each step to listen.<br><br>“Where are the letters?”<br><br>Luis coughed and struggled with every word. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m just an old man who hoards a lot of useless junk from around the world.”<br><br>Max reached the living room and peeked through the open doorway.<br><br>One agent prepared a small bottle of orange serum and held it up to Luis. “I’ll ask my questions, again. Disappoint me and you get a drop of Grime. Disappoint me, again, and we move to a spoonful. Another time, and it’s the bottle. If we’re mistaken, and you’re just an old man who likes to hoard junk from around the world, then you have no idea what Grime will do to you.”<br><br>The agent tilted the bottle and let a drop form at the rim of the bottle and asked, “Where are the letters? Where are The Crows? Who else knows about them?”<br><br>Luis shook his head. “You’re dealing with forces you couldn’t possibly understand.”<br><br>The agent smiled and let a drop of Grime fall into Luis’ busted mouth. Luis struggled to keep his mouth closed, but the drop dissolved into his cuts and swollen lips.<br><br>“I’m told a drop of Grime unlocks a doorway to hell,” the agent said. “I can’t imagine what a bottle would do. Let’s try, again, and let’s not presume to know what I would and wouldn’t understand.”<br><br>Luis scoffed. “You remind me of myself when I was first at the agency. Do you even know who you’re working for? Who you’re really working for? Not the government. Not even the corporations. That’s what I thought at first when I realized we weren’t working for the government… I thought we were working for the corporations… But they’re just tools like the agency for a very dark end.”<br><br>“Where are the letters!”<br><br>The agent filled a spoon with serum and thrust it into his mouth, breaking his four front teeth.<br><br>Luis gagged and coughed and spat blood and saliva. After a long moment he said, “You know the serum you hold is made from a very peculiar flower that comes from another place. And I don’t mean another country.”<br><br>“Where are The Crows!”<br><br>“Your true masters are into some crazy shit. They are. They don’t just sacrifice people to their ancient god. No. That would be too easy. They go a step beyond. They sacrifice villages, towns and countries, turning them into places of fear. It’s all about the fear… hate… anger…”<br><br>Luis nodded.<br><br>“What we did in the 50s and 70s was just the beginning. They want to sacrifice the world. They do. They think by turning this world into a living hell they’ll bring forth transcendence.”<br><br>The agent sighed. “You are a stubborn old mule, aren’t you.” He grabbed his hair, tilted his head back and smashed the bottle into his mouth just as Max sprung from the shadows in one fluid motion, firing two rounds into each surprised face. Then he rushed to Luis and pulled the bottle out of his gaping mouth.<br><br>Luis smiled at Max. “I ain’t getting out of this one. I can already hear the voices… the horror…”<br><br>“Luis, stay with me.”<br><br>Luis stared at Max for a long moment. Then he said, “You’re the ones, they’re after—the wrench in their finely oiled killing machine.”<br><br>Max nodded as the Comms in his ear sounded. “Ask him about what they wanted?” He inched closer to Luis. “What do you have that scares them so much?”<br><br>Luis smiled. “Words.”<br><br>“Words?”<br><br>“Poetry. Art. Letters.” Luis began to sob, and Max was sure the serum was beginning to act on his faculties. Then he continued, “I thought I was a patriot, preventing threats to our way of life. Imagine my surprise when I found out the agency is just a tool for a bunch of rich assholes in dark robes. I hurt so many people… they’re coming for me… ”<br><br>“What did they want?”<br><br>Luis struggled against the poison coursing through his veins.<br><br>“We targeted her because she was connected. She could see things in the other world. She could see their faces and she could paint them in a way no remote viewer ever could. When we tried to own her… her voice… her art… so she wouldn’t expose us… she still painted… whatever she wanted.”<br><br>Luis fell silent, and his face tightened.<br><br>“Her mother was the same, and we intercepted her letters to her daughter. We couldn’t let her know her mother was still alive. Both mother and daughter had something between them we couldn’t possibly understand. A variable we had somehow overlooked.”<br><br>Luis groaned and trembled and struggled to calm himself before he continued.<br><br>“We paid her father to keep a close eye on her and report anything unusual in her art. She could see crows from the other world… she told her father they were following her, protecting her, and he thought she was crazy.”<br><br>Luis began to breathe heavily.<br><br>“It was all there in her collection…The Crows… a blueprint of how they planned to sacrifice the entire world to their ancient god. I’ve seen the paintings, and I still don’t get it. I hate what we did to that poor girl and her brother. At least the mother… got away…”<br><br>Luis trailed away. He collected his thoughts and took in a deep breath.<br><br>“The girl nearly got away too. She ran, and she started a collective of artists, a rebellion we didn’t control, and they painted and wrote poetry against the corruption—against the darkness.”<br><br>Luis shook his head, almost in disbelief.<br><br>“They published a book of poetry along with an underground magazine. We had to find every single one of those books and periodicals and burn them.”<br><br>Luis began to stammer.<br><br>“Her mistake was going to her father… for all the things she had seen she did not see him.”<br><br>Luis lost himself for a moment. Tears formed in his eyes and slowly slipped down his face as he continued.<br><br>“She was just an experiment and she ended up turning against us. She was the key, the leader, the inspiration for them and for me…”<br><br>His eyes widened as though he saw something horrible behind Max. He closed his eyes and when he opened them again he continued with difficulty.<br><br>“What we did to them… I will never forgive myself for.”<br><br>“Do you have the letters?”<br><br>“They’re coming for me! I can hear them!”<br><br>“Do you have the paintings!”<br><br>Luis started, then nodded as he struggled for every breath.<br><br>Max realized he didn’t have much time. “Are they in the house?” he asked, leaning closer to Luis. But Luis didn’t answer. He tried to speak with difficultly, whispering:<br><br>“15… 13…”<br><br>He repeated the numbers again, then suddenly shrieked and thrashed in the chair. Max tried to rip the tape off his arms as he jerked about, making the chair thump against the creaking floors.<br><br>When Max finally freed him, Luis jackknifed to his feet, charged past him and dove straight through the window. Bleeding from multiple lacerations, he crawled toward the cemetery before his mouth froze in a hideous scream of terror.<br><br><br><br>OUTSIDE IN THE GROWING DARKNESS, Max knelt beside Luis checking for a pulse but didn’t find any. Luis' eyes were wide and his hand extended out toward the cemetery. “Nothing you could have done for him,” Haddie’s voice sounded in his ears. Max stared at the dead man’s hands, then the cemetery where he saw gravestones in the moonlight.<br><br>“15… 13… It could be a safety deposit box.” Haddie observed.<br><br>Max nodded. “Yeah, it could be.” He narrowed his eyes on the cemetery. The trail of blood Luis left on the ground was like an arrow pointing to a gravestone. “Hold on, I got a hunch.”<br><br>Max stood and proceeded toward the cemetery.<br><br>“You need to be careful. There could be more agents on their way.”<br><br>“Government agents I can handle. It’s the other shit I’m worried about.”<br><br><br><br>MAX FOUND A BURIAL PLOT MARKED 1513 IN THE SMALL CEMETERY, and using a shovel he had found in a barn, he dug deep into the ground until he hit a coffin. He jumped down into the hole and brushed the dirt off the lid with his blistered hands. Then he heaved the rotten lid open to find a thick lining of black plastic. As he ripped the plastic apart, the scent of wet earth, paint and burnt wood hit him like slap in the face. But within moments he found himself staring at sketches, books, envelopes, statuettes and paintings from different times and origins. “Jackpot!” he said, and activated his cellphone camera to send a live stream to Haddie who was sitting safely in the back of a cramped bookstore in New York City.<br><br>“Mora,” Haddie said as she observed the paintings. “We’ve sensed she was ‘marked’ like the others but could never prove it. She was clearly connected…” Her voice trailed away pensively as he held the cellphone above a painting of a medieval lord surrounded by stacks of bodies in a crumbling castle. “Looks like another artist… also seeing into the other realm…”<br><br>Max scanned the paintings, then moved on to a copy of a book titled, ‘Poets Against the Darkness.’ From within the book he pulled out an envelope with ‘WSFM’ written on it. “What does WSFM stand for?”<br><br>“Weird Science and Freakin' Magic department.”<br><br>Max chuckled. “What?”<br><br>“True story… you’re starting to lag—”<br><br>Max looked up and to his horror he noticed a thick, unnatural fog creeping over the open grave. “Shit!” he said with dawning realization. “I think I’m in a Bleed. I think that’s why Luis hid the artifacts here.”<br><br>But Haddie didn’t respond. A high pitch whine sounded in his ear and he instantly pulled off the earpiece. As he thrust his comms into his pocket, he saw crows circling above and felt his entire body suddenly prickle with needles. His body was reacting to another vibration as he shifted in and out of another dimension. As he tried to gather himself, he heard a twig snap above. He looked up to see a tall woman made of darkness standing by the grave.<br><br>Max quickly hid inside the coffin, pulling the wooden lid over. He stared through a crack in the wood at the dark apparition looming above him. It stared down at the coffin with cold black eyes and black blood like ink dripping down from its fingers. A crow flew down into the grave, landing on the coffin, pecking nervously at the lid, giving away his position.<br><br>Max closed his eyes and waited to be dragged away to this other world. But the crow disappeared and the apparition drifted away from the grave. Max quietly slipped out of the coffin and climbed out of the grave, ascending into a world of fog. He could hear the crows circling above but couldn’t see them. As he ran, he heard the sound of his heart thumping against his chest, and then he heard footsteps. Behind him. Growing faster. Louder.<br><br>Max glanced over his shoulder but saw only a mass of fog. He didn’t wait for whatever lurked in the darkness to snatch him. He charged through the cemetery, jumped over the fence and stumbled miserably to the ground. Then he closed his eyes and lost consciousness as a high-pitched whine filled his ear.<br><br>When at last he opened his eyes, it was morning and beams of golden sunlight poured through the cracks of a door illuminating the darkness and warming his face. He had no recollection of what had transpired, only vague flashbacks of dragging himself over the ground while unnatural and incomprehensible things moved around him.<br><br>He remembered the crows, the woman with the black eyes, and the shrieks and screams that rent the night. He remembered seeing the outhouse and crawling through a layer of fog. He remembered opening the creaking, red door and hiding inside. Everything else was a blur.<br><br>Covered in dirt and filth, he stepped out into the harsh, white sunlight. He grabbed his phone and called Haddie. A moment later her face appeared on the small screen.<br><br>“Thought we lost you there.”<br><br>“I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck… but I’m still here…” Max turned round and round, staring at the old farm. “I don’t remember much.”<br><br>“You were out the whole night.”<br><br>“Yeah… well… It felt like an eternity.”"
Chamber of Blood. The Redcrane. Snake in the Garden.,Tome12_03,"Saku spent the day piling the decomposing bodies she had discovered in the remote mountain village. Mothers. Fathers. Brothers. Sisters. Children. All killed in a ritualistic manner. And as night descended, she set the victims of the Black Serpent Society ablaze. The flames rose violently and shot burning red embers into the black abyss above. As the fire waved and crackled, Saku watched the flames devour flesh and tried not to think of the suffering the Society had put the village through. One of their members was ‘Becoming’ and the Becoming ceremony was a rite of passage. The member would drink tea brewed from the purple petals of a flower they harvested from another world, and this tea either killed them or brought them a nightmare from this other world that they would have to recreate in this one. She had witnessed three of these nightmares before. Horrifying monuments made out of villagers who had been hunted down like game and tortured and restructured into a human offering. She didn’t know what horrors these snakes had seen in the other world, but whatever they had seen could not have been more horrific and brutal than what they created in this world.<br><br>Reflecting on the offerings Saku had seen in the past, she expected she would find a similar offering not too far from the village. And so, preparing for the worst, she grabbed a branch on the ground and lit a torch from the burning pyre. Carefully, she made her way into the surrounding woods.<br><br>It wasn’t long before Saku found a pile of clothing and a trail of gore and petals. She followed the trail to a mound of beautiful flowers growing from the hacked bodies of villagers. With a sigh, she examined the area, the flickering torchlight lighting the way. Within moments, she realized the area had been hacked and cleared so that it resembled a kind of maze. The villagers had been hunted and captured in this maze that was meant to resemble a snake’s nightmare.<br><br>That’s what she called members of the Society.<br><br>Snakes.<br><br>There was nothing human about them. People had warmth and empathy, and these cultists lacked both and likely had cold blood running through their veins. And Saku knew the creator of this maze and offering might still be around, embedded in its offering to the Black Serpent, symbolically shedding its human skin.<br><br>Saku turned back to the offering and held her breath as she searched the ghastly faces of the dead for signs of life. As she searched for the snake in this garden of death, she suddenly heard the crackle of undergrowth behind her. Instinctively, Saku ducked as a thick ax whirred over her head and cut through flowers and a bloated torso. Stepping back, she dropped the torch and turned to face a snake in a demon mask shrieking at her. The snake withdrew the ax attacked wildly.<br><br>With short, quick steps, Saku evaded savage blows. Then she withdrew her gleaming sword and in one fluid motion, she decapitated the snake and watched the headless torso stagger left and right as a fountain of warm blood sprayed the ground and trees. The torso collapsed and became one with the offering as the head rolled away and finally stopped at the base of a tree.<br><br>Saku walked over to the head, picked it up, and removed the mask to reveal a young woman with wide, unblinking eyes. Feeling sad for this woman who had been charmed, groomed and corrupted by the Society, she carried the head to the offering where she placed it next to the torso.<br><br>Gently, Saku picked up the flickering torch from the ground and set the offering on fire. The burning stack of bodies reflected bright orange in her eyes as she remembered her clan and wondered if she would ever stop the Society from corrupting and destroying her beloved country."
DAWN OF THE FLESH EATERS 1,Tome12_03,"“WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?” Lori asked as she followed Ian through the woods.<br><br>“Point Pleasant Peak.” Ian stepped toward a chain-link fence, searching for the hole he had created a week ago, sidestepping a pile of bones and gore that had once been a coyote.<br><br>“We shouldn’t be here. We should turn back.”<br><br>“Nonsense,” Ian said, finding the hole in the fence. “It’s going to be just like old times.”<br><br>Except that it wasn’t. Today would be better than old times. Today would be a special day—a day like none other. A day that would rise above all other days.<br><br>Ian had been planning the hike to their special place for a little over a year, and nothing would get in his way. Not the fence. Not the law. Not even the creepy genetic research institute that had bought up all the land.<br><br>“You know… they closed the trail for a reason.”<br><br>“They closed the trail because some corrupt mayor sold public land to a corporation. Should have never happened in the first place.” Ian yanked at the edge of the hole in the fence. “Let’s get to the peak and snap some pictures.”<br><br>Lori smiled at him, then crouched and pushed her way through the hole, saying, “What’s the worst thing that can happen?”"
DAWN OF THE FLESH EATERS 2,Tome12_03,"A DEEP ORANGE GLOW penetrated the canopy as Ian and Lori followed an old trail up to Point Pleasant Peak. The air was fresh and cool and every now and then Lori stopped to snap a picture of a plant or flower or bird while Ian checked his pocket for the little black box that contained all the hopes and dreams he had for their collective lives. He was going to do it. He was really going to do it.<br><br>Lori stopped suddenly and pointed at two hawks circling in the distance. Ian stepped up to her, observing, and she snapped pictures.<br><br>An omen, he thought. A beautiful, majestic couple working together in complete harmony. They circled together in the amber sky, one clockwise, the other counter-clockwise. Their graceful paths twined and intersected with wings fully spread as they searched for dinner. Then they stopped circling and swept down with wings half-bent, disappearing into the woods.<br><br>Lori trained her camera at the trees waiting for the hawks to reemerge with dinner. But when no hawk burst from the trees after a few minutes, they continued up the trail, reminiscing about the first time they had met on the trail. He had seen her feeding squirrels to draw them closer for a picture. He remembered telling her it was bad luck to feed wild life. She told him to mind his business, that she made her own luck. They had been together ever since."
DAWN OF THE FLESH EATERS 3,Tome12_03,"IAN DIDN’T UNDERSTAND why Lori suddenly froze as she clambered up the trail. “What’s wrong?” he asked, stepping up beside her.<br><br>Lori shook her head slowly. “I feel like we’re being watched.”<br><br>“You’re letting your imagination get the better of you. Come on, let’s go.”<br><br>A soft chirping sound began from every direction.<br><br>“I don’t recognize that sound.”<br><br>“Just birds.”<br><br>“Well, that’s not coming from birds!”<br><br>The sound suddenly faded into silence.<br><br>Ian nudged her, and smiled and gestured for her to continue up the trail. She did, but within moments they both stopped at the sight of two dead hawks surrounded by feathers and warm blood.<br><br>“Looks like they messed with the wrong mouse.” Ian swallowed hard, trying to make light of the situation, secretly hoping he’d get another omen along the way.<br><br>Lori snapped a picture. “Something’s not right… What could have done that to a hawk?”<br><br>Ian didn’t answer for a long, pensive moment. Then he forced a laugh, grabbed her hand and led her up the trail to their special place."
DAWN OF THE FLESH EATERS 4,Tome12_03,"THE FOREST WAS strangely quiet when Ian and Lori came upon a cottontail in the middle of the trail. They stood before the bunny for a moment, staring into its small black eyes. Ian was pretty sure a rabbit was a good omen and was a sign that the day would turn out exactly as he had planned.<br><br>“Seven years good luck if you feed a helpless bunny.” Lori laughed and searched her rucksack for a carrot.<br><br>“Don’t…”<br><br>“Come on, the poor chub looks like it hasn’t eaten in days.”<br><br>Ian sighed. “I guess one carrot isn’t the end of the world.”<br><br>Lori prepared her camera as she extended the carrot to the rabbit. As she did, the strange chirping sound returned, rising louder and louder all around them.<br><br>A cold tingle suddenly ran down Ian’s spine. Something about the critter’s eyes told him they had made a grave error in judgement and that the day wouldn’t be as perfect as he had imagined it would be.<br><br>Lori inched back from the seemingly helpless rabbit, then stumbled on her haunches as it suddenly roared with a mouth filled with needle-like teeth. The roar was a call and soon hundreds of flesh eating rabbits sprang out of the shadows and surrounded them.<br><br>Ian didn’t process much after that. He fell back and hit his head on a boulder as millions of needles punctured his skin and ripped away flesh, muscle and bone. He heard Lori scream and for a moment he wished he hadn’t been such a damn romantic. Then black fog filled his vision as he yelled out a question and his stubborn hand fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a small black box."
Year Seven. Day 207. Morning.,Tome12_03,"Since we’ve arrived at the tower James has spent most of his time going through the stories and journals left by the previous occupants. He keeps a journal of his own and is determined to write a movie about our collective experience. The other day I looked over his shoulder to see what he was writing in his notebook. To my surprise, he had transcribed an entire conversation between the Parks. I cleared my throat to secure his attention. He turned around, startled, staring at me with I could only describe as a homicidal glare. It was as though I had interrupted the writing of the Declaration of Independence. I questioned the etiquette and morality of eavesdropping. He questioned the etiquette and morality of reading over his shoulder. He then added that anything and everything is fair game for a writer."
Year Seven. Day 207. Afternoon.,Tome12_03,I went up to my favourite spot on the roof of the tower where I listened to memories recorded on vinyl records by one of the previous occupants whose disappearance still remains a mystery. The air smelt of ammonia and wet leaves; the fog tossed and heaved and rolled endlessly toward the horizon as laughter and arguments rose from the ninth floor. Donald the carpenter and a few others built a mini-putt out of all the things from other worlds for our amusement and entertainment.
MEMORY 708,Tome13_01,"Horror stories. They’ve fascinated Danny since he was a kid. His father told the best horror stories, and those stories always gave him what no other story could: a greater appreciation for his life. The vivid words. The creepy sounds. The perfectly designed dramatic pauses that made him suddenly conscious of the pounding heartbeat in his ears. Wanting the story to continue and stop at the same time. Uncomfortable. Unsettled. Yet, captivated. And then—<br><br>The climax!<br><br>And the rush of adrenaline that followed.<br><br>But the adrenaline wasn’t what he enjoyed the most. No. It was something else. It was… he wasn’t sure what it was… He didn’t want to save the world, or win the Olympics, or travel to a foreign country to see something new and exotic. He just wanted the horror to end. He wanted his life back.<br><br>The scarier the story the more he appreciated his life. And to know that his father’s stories were true doubled that feeling. Doubled the spell the story had on him. The truth of those stories made them far more potent than those dark fantasies that came from the imagination. His father’s stories were real and that made them scarier.<br><br>Much scarier.<br><br>His father wanted him to design stories just like he did. Follow his path. Hunt and murder human beings in the shadows.<br><br>And he did.<br><br>Just not in the way his father had intended.<br><br>And now Danny designs better stories. Much better stories. Better because of the setting. Because they could happen anywhere, unlike his father’s stories which took place in what experts called ‘abnormal circumstances’ where scary and gruesome stories were expected.<br><br>His settings made the horror all the more unique.<br><br>All the more unexpected.<br><br>And now, as Danny sits on his couch in his air-conditioned studio apartment, he feels the sudden need to design another story. And so he reaches for a yellow legal pad sitting on a coffee table and sifts through the contents searching for potential victims."
MEMORY 717,Tome13_01,"The last ten minutes are a blur. Everything happened in a flash of emotion. He remembers moments. Brief moments. Turning on the strobe lights. Cranking up the music. Activating the dry ice machine. Hunting the three stooges in slow motion through the cool, misty arena. And now he yanks the gleaming hunter knife out of a pulpy face rendered completely unrecognizable.<br><br>Shit. I must have stabbed him a hundred times in the head.<br><br>Danny narrows his gaze on the face but the strobe light plays tricks on him. Makes the face look like his past victims—the faces changing with every blink of light.<br><br>He shakes his head and stares hard at the face. This is Tom. No. Can’t be. Tom he stabbed in the legs. He’s still alive, groveling about like a worm somewhere.<br><br>What about Pete? No. Can’t be, Pete. He’s pretty sure he decapitated Pete. It’s not what he intended, but shit happens. He pushed the knife a little too hard. Cut a little too deep. A little too fiercely.<br><br>Well, if it isn’t Pete. And it isn’t Tom. It must be Bradley. Good’ol Bradley. He’s confronted with a sudden image of Bradley screaming as he silences him with a blade through the mouth. He nods and sighs. Yeah, it’s Bradley. Definitely, Bradley.<br><br>He stares at the mangled face for a long moment. It’s not as bad as he thought it would be. A little messy, but he can find a way to make this work.<br><br>The last time he improvised a design was with his dad. Bless his soul. He deserved a better design, a much better execution, but he hadn’t realized how much he had bottled up inside. All those training drills and unrealistic expectations to bring back stories and medals pushed him over the edge.<br><br>It just came pouring out one night while camping in a way he hadn’t expected. Happens all the time. Every day. To the best. He just didn’t think it could happen to him. And here it is happening again.<br><br>The music stops for a moment to reveal someone sobbing and screaming for help.<br><br>Tom.<br><br>Danny marches through flashing light and dark, following a trail of warm blood through the maze. Soon the blood leads him to a young man dragging himself across the cement ground, desperately inching toward an exit door.<br><br>Danny approaches him menacingly. He kneels before him and stares at him. Despite the air-conditioning he feels sweat drip down his face and drip into the gathering pool of blood. And as he watches the sweat drip off his face, he realizes—<br><br>He isn’t wearing his mask. He touches his warm, bloody face and vaguely remembers removing the mask in the staff room after her ripped down every last caricature.<br><br>That’s because The Ghost Face has nothing to do with this. This is something else. There’s no way he’s crediting The Ghost Face with these clumsy yet incredibly satisfying kills.<br><br>Tom looks up at Danny.<br><br>Danny wipes the sweat and blood off his face. They lock eyes.<br><br>Not so funny now, is it?<br><br>Danny places his knife in Tom’s hand.<br><br>You know what a copycat is, don’t you? Well, that’s what you are. A failed copycat. A parody of a true killer.<br><br>Tom tries to attack Danny with the knife.<br><br>Easy there, Tom. You might hurt yourself…<br><br>Tom’s arm falls and splatters in blood, the knife dangling from the fingertips. He struggles to wrap his wet fingers around the hilt and attacks with the knife, hitting air over and over again.<br><br>Danny laughs. Politicians will use your story to campaign against beer, rock-and-roll and horror movies. That’s the current angle I’m considering. You like that angle, Tom?<br><br>Tom gasps and struggles to say something without success.<br><br>Danny inches closer. He lowers his voice to a cruel whisper and suggests a potential headline for his next article—<br><br>Ghost Copycat. Tragedy hits Roseville Coliseum. Employee stabs two of his colleagues to death before suffering a lethal injury.<br><br>Danny considers, then offers an alternative version—<br><br>Joke taken too far. Tragedy hits Roseville Coliseum. Three employees die in a prank gone horribly wrong after a night of drinking, rock-and-roll and horror movies.<br><br>Danny tilts his head slightly. He considers both versions of the story. The drinking, rock-and-roll and horror movies offer a comfortable scapegoat. It gives readers something to point to.<br><br>Something to blame.<br><br>A place to hide.<br><br>And he isn’t sure he wants to give his readers a place to hide with this one. He leans closer to Tom. What do you think? Copycat or bad joke?<br><br>Tom murmurs something incoherent.<br><br>Danny smiles. Sorry, I didn’t really get that. You’re gonna have to speak up, buddy. Take a deep breath… enunciate. Come on… you’re so full of fuckin' opinions… I’m sure you have an opinion on how you’d like to be remembered.<br><br>Tom writhes desperately and manages to issue one last, gasping scream before dying.<br><br>Danny sighs and closes his eyes against the blinking light. He still isn’t sure which angle to take, and it doesn’t really matter, anyway. Either version will do its job and scare the good citizens of Roseville into fastening the mask a little tighter before bed while they count their lucky stars and appreciate their ridiculously insane, suburban lives."
MEMORY 709,Tome13_01,"Danny goes through the legal pad searching for the perfect profile for his next design. What he’s looking for is the ordinary. The relatable. The perfect victim that will make his readers think and feel it could have been them. Someone who does everything by the book. Someone who doesn’t deserve to die. As if deserve had anything to do with it. He rips out pages, all the candidates with criminal records or those who are too loud in the community. He can’t have his readers confused with hate, revenge, jealously or gang violence. There can be no hiding place for the reader. They need to identify with the victim. They need to be able to see themselves in the story or it fails. It just doesn’t work. And as he searches for his one-size-fits-all profile, his fingers fumble over a name: John Michaels. A person with two first names. Fantastic. He glances over his surveillance notes. Nine-to-five. Award-winning teacher. Single. Townhouse with a white picket fence. Doesn’t really deserve to die. Perfect."
MEMORY 710,Tome13_01,"John Michaels. A perfect name for the next chapter in his book. Every John and Michael will consciously or unconsciously be drawn to the headline. The name itself will attract a sizeable audience. And the story will grip them in the talons of fear, only to release them at the very end. Horror heaped on horror until at the end they’re begging for release—begging for their lives back. He laughs to himself as he watches John exit the community college where he teaches anthropology. He took a class in anthropology once. And he remembers the heated debates with his teacher who tried to make him believe in this ridiculous theory of the homo sapiens—that humanity was intrinsically curious and intelligent species that evolved toward peace and prosperity with its many civilizations and achievements.<br><br>Danny argued the opposite. He argued humans were intrinsic killers—killers that evolved to enslave, acquire, destroy and eventually self-destruct. That the achievements and the civilizations were tools for blood. That the mask of civilization was a façade, a farce, an elaborate design to hide the true face of humanity—the bloody face of horror, as he often liked to call it. The bloody face of horror always found a way to break through the mask. Always. The more we contained and hid the truth, the stronger and more creative it got in breaking free. As if it had a life of its own. A need of its own.<br><br>They were fun debates. His teacher cited the golden age of prosperity at the turn of the century and Danny countered with World War One. His teacher talked about the advent of electricity, and Danny talked about the electric chair and the electrocution of an elephant at a festival. His teacher raved about tractors and the Green Revolution, and he raved about tanks and Agent Orange. His teacher pointed to the airplane and all the great opportunities flight brought humanity. And Danny pointed to the bombs. And that was the end of the argument.<br><br>All that curiosity and inventiveness paid for in blood and used to shed even more blood.<br><br>His teacher called these extreme situations. Abnormal situations. Misuse of human ingenuity. But Danny wasn’t convinced. Danny claimed there were more abnormal than normal situations in any given century including the twentieth century.<br><br>Especially the twentieth century.<br><br>The twentieth century saw great advances in knowledge and technology but not wisdom.<br><br>Never wisdom.<br><br>Wisdom always came last if it came at all.<br><br>Ten years of blood for every day of peace. That’s what his old man said almost every dawn when he’d drop a penny on his bed to check if it was made properly. Stern as steel. Hard as a rock. Crazy as a loon. But not wrong. Definitely, not wrong."
MEMORY 711,Tome13_01,"Danny wakes up in his black sedan covered in sweat. He dozed off and that’s not like him. It’s the broken air conditioner and humidity making him groggy. He opens his heavy eyelids and cranes his sticky neck to see John through the living room window getting his horror fix from the late-hour news. Mass fear stimulating the adrenaline glands and slowly becoming relief and appreciation for abnormal, day-to-day, civilized living. Ten horror stories for every one feel-good story. That was the media ratio, and the secret to growing an audience and running a successful news business with paying advertisers.<br><br>John suddenly jerks to his feet.<br><br>Danny figures he lost reception, again as he observes John approach the TV. He fiddles with two long antennas, smacks the side of the story-box, then sits back down and sips on a warm glass of milk as he takes in the horrors of the world in the safety and security of his home.<br><br>Danny makes a note on his yellow pad about the TV. He could probably use it in his final design along with the refrigerator. As he considers the possibilities of building tension, a bead of sweat drips off his nose and splats on the pen. He wipes his face with his arm wishing he had the money to repair his air conditioner. Then he realizes he’ll complete his design soon, and his story, and with his story a paycheck.

At that precise moment, he’ll leap out of the shadows like a panther in the night and trigger the first and final scream of John Michaels—<br><br>The most upstanding citizen of Roseville and the most undeserving of such a grisly and unprovoked death.<br><br>It’s perfect.<br><br>In the hot and humid sedan Danny visualizes slipping the knife through John’s neck and severing the tongue mid-scream—freezing his face in wide, gaping terror. He knows if he visualizes the kill several times it will improve his odds at success. His father taught him that. Taught him to visualize every beat of the design. He assured him it was what made him a medal-winning hunter of human beings. The thing they don’t teach you in killing school.<br><br>Danny visualizes the design once more. Then he opens his eyes and exits the car, moving through the shadows toward the back door of the picture-perfect house. He glides past the fence and scans the backyard for a moment. Then he lifts and fiddles with the glass door until he hears a click. Carefully, he slides the door open and enters the air-conditioned home.<br><br>He takes a moment to cool down in the narrow hallway. Then he moves toward the dark kitchen, slowly opening the refrigerator door and enjoying a nice cool waft of air in the process. A soft beam of warm, yellow light illuminates the floor and the small round breakfast table beside him.<br><br>Everything is going as planned. But then, as Danny turns, something in his peripheral catches his eye. Gives him pause. He tilts his head slightly, narrows his gaze and pulls off his mask to make sure he’s seeing what he thinks he’s seeing. As he takes in the horror spread across the table, his face freezes in a silent scream."
MEMORY 713,Tome13_01,"Danny closes his mouth and reaches out to a small, underground newspaper. He lifts the front page of ‘The Urban Farce’ and examines a caricature of his legend based on police descriptions taken from an intoxicated witness he had deliberately spared during his last design. He wants to slowly build an image in the imaginations of his readers and now…<br><br>…Now a bunch of idiots were making a complete joke of his creation with parody. With god damn parody! The worst genre that ever existed. A bloated parasite that fed off the creations of others!<br><br>How dare they make a joke of his life’s work!<br><br>Danny breathes hard and tries to compose himself. He realizes he can’t go through with tonight’s design. Too many emotions swirling around, undermining his focus. Anger. Hate. Humiliation. Disbelief. Everything feels hazy. Hazy and emotional like his first design.<br><br>Those were different circumstances. But his first design taught him how emotion can undermine even the best design. He quickly turns to close the refrigerator door, but he’s already too late and—<br><br>A piercing chime sounds through the small house.<br><br>Shit!<br><br>Danny quickly retreats into the darkness of the pantry leaving the door slightly ajar.<br><br>Within moments, John enters the kitchen yawning. He stands before the refrigerator scratching his head, confused. He yawns, again, and stares at leftovers, contemplating a little midnight snack. Then, mumbling something incoherent to himself, he closes the refrigerator door leaving them in the shadows.<br><br>He should leave now. Go back to bed. But—<br><br>John doesn’t leave.<br><br>He just stands there as though sensing something’s amiss.<br><br>Danny can see John’s silhouette through the slight opening. It seems like John is approaching him, but he can’t be sure. His heart pounds in his throat. His blood boils through his veins. He feels weak, light-headed, almost like he’s going to faint. This can’t be happening.<br><br>He doesn’t just kill.<br><br>He designs.<br><br>A dark shadow approaches the pantry.<br><br>Danny gathers himself and prepares to lunge with his knife. But he knows—<br><br>It’s all wrong! Raw and primal and about something else.<br><br>Please… don’t open that fuckin' door. Please…<br><br>Danny holds his breath and waits for the inevitable."
MEMORY 714,Tome13_01,"John Michaels must have had at least one more lucky star that night. Had John opened that pantry door Danny would have had no choice but to end his days as an awe-inspiring teacher. But he didn’t, and he gave Danny a chance to escape with The Urban Farce.<br><br>Now Danny stares through binoculars at the post office waiting for the editors or artists to show up. He needs to act fast and put a stop to this overt assault on his image. Parody. It had to be parody. God damn parody. The artist took a few vague statements about a ghost-like figure with a gaping mouth and turned those perfectly crafted statements into a joke. An absolute joke. Now, more than ever, he realizes that he’ll have to get a proper likeness of his terrifying mask out to the public before everything he’s worked toward is undone by a caricature.<br><br>And what if this parody is all that people remember?<br><br>Won’t happen. I’ve collected them all.<br><br>He turns to a massive stack of newspapers in the back seat of his car. He must have spent the entire night collecting every single copy of The Urban Farce from phone booths around the neighborhood.<br><br>He scrunches his fist into a ball, sighs heavily and doesn’t understand the humor. There’s nothing funny about what he does. He provides a kind of misunderstood therapy for those suffering from the madness of suburban living. He makes the citizens of Roseville feel good about their monotonous lives. He gives them respite and relief. He protects the mask of civilization with his mask, and they’re laughing at that. Just like they laughed at his father when he returned.<br><br>He grinds his teeth.<br><br>Only trust fund idiots trying to be rebellious would publish this kind of shit.<br><br>A person enters the post office. Danny tracks him with the binoculars to box—<br><br>19.<br><br>Not the publisher.<br><br>He then follows another man to box—<br><br>7.<br><br>Him neither.<br><br>And yet another man accesses box—<br><br>15.<br><br>He lowers the binoculars and calms his humiliated heart. He regards the newspaper one more time. Letters to the editor. He scans the address and notes the PO Box. Then he looks up and suddenly spots a young man walking into the post office. He tracks his movement past the desk to box—<br><br>13.<br><br>Bingo!"
MEMORY 715,Tome13_01,"10:03 PM. Danny sits in his car watching the three stooges lock up the Roseville Coliseum. That’s what he calls them stooges. All of them—Tom, Pete, and Bradley—college dropouts working for Tom’s dad at the Coliseum. They’ll sweep the floor, take inventory, hang out in the staff room and work on their garbage newspaper, using dad’s photocopier. Then they’ll finish the night with one or two beers and a quick round of laser tag. Spoiled little shits with nothing better to do with their lives than drink and debate movies and distract their peanut brains with arcades and laser tag. But still—<br><br>He’s grateful for their names.<br><br>Perfect names.<br><br>They’re the kind of names you’d expect in a blockbuster. A ridiculous story where Tom, Pete, and Bradley enter an ‘extreme situation’ to kill all the badies only to return home without a scratch.<br><br>Without a goddamn scratch.<br><br>Against technologically superior enemy.<br><br>Now that would be parody if it weren’t propaganda.<br><br>The kind of propaganda that convinces all the Toms and Petes and Brads to sign up to kill human beings. The kind of story his dad hated because of how much he respected the actual badies who hunted him for all those years. The true story is—<br><br>Pete and Bradley don’t come back home.<br><br>They die.<br><br>Horrible deaths.<br><br>And Tom has to return to a suburban town that no longer accepts him because he sees right through the mask and it just doesn’t fit him anymore. And because it doesn’t fit anymore, they’ll sweep him under the rug of civilization and try to forget him because of the truth he represents. And Tom will stare at the perfectly manicured lawns and the white picket fences and know. And always know—<br><br>It’s all a façade.<br><br>Danny watches the laughing, intoxicated three stooges enter the staff room.<br><br>Go ahead, laugh. You’ll soon realize what happens when you cross lines that shouldn’t be crossed.<br><br>Danny feels acid rising up his throat. He tells himself he will soon have the last laugh. The challenge of this design is to overcome his bubbling rage. And he feels he’s almost ready. He just has to go through the Coliseum and search for the most ideal place for the perfect scream. For now, he’s leaning toward the staff room, but he knows that might change once he’s actually walked the space."
MEMORY 716,Tome13_01,"10:04 PM. Tom, Pete and Bradley lock up a minute later than usual. Danny stands in the shadows away from the bright street lights, observing them through a glass door. When they disappear into the staff room, he puts on his beloved, bone-white mask and prepares for his first walk through of the setting. He’ll walk through the Coliseum at least two more times before he finalizes the design, allowing his ideas to work themselves out.<br><br>Time to incubate is the secret to any great design.<br><br>And it’s the phase he knows not to rush. It’s the most important phase. Everything else is just execution.<br><br>Danny laughs at his pun as he glides through the darkness toward the exit door. How often did he have issues with his design only to be struck by inspiration in the middle of the night? He knows now that if he has any creative blocks he just has to sleep on it. There’s something about sleep that polishes every design.<br><br>Now Danny opens the exit door which he tinkered with earlier in the day. Stealthily, he enters the arcade, gliding past the small concessions booth toward the growing sound of a debate. He hides near the staff room where he hears the loud and obnoxious stooges argue over horror movies and killers.<br><br>Danny suddenly feels the blood rushing up his neck as they get everything wrong. Idiots poking fun at something they don’t understand, or, at best, think they understand. Idiots criticizing some of the greatest designs and spewing vitriol about how they could have done better. So much better. Tom even suggests that they should work together to create a design of their own. Give Roseville something to be really scared of.<br><br>Danny clenches a fist and wants to rush inside the staff room and rip their heads off. He takes a moment to calm himself. In a week or so he’ll have his moment with these arrogant idiots. The intellectual masturbation of those who shout from the sidelines and wonder what it’s like to actually step into the ring. They exist in every creative field. He knows that, and laughs at himself for actually letting them get in his head. He’d actually love to see the stooges attempt their own design. They would fumble and fuck up every beat up to the very climax. He almost wants to spare them just to see what they’d end up doing.<br><br>Almost.<br><br>Danny regards his watch. One minute more. He counts the seconds as they complain and spew hot air about the perfect design and how they alone could execute it. The boasting and bravado fades and is quickly replaced with rock-and-roll blasting on the Coliseum speakers.<br><br>With quick steps, Danny retreats behind a beeping arcade as the idiots spill out of the staff room and enter the laser tag arena for a quick fix of adrenaline. He quietly steps out of the shadows and counts ten paces to the staff room. He has exactly twenty-two minutes before their game ends.<br><br>He opens the door and enters the tiny room but unexpectedly gags when he’s hit with the foul stench of stale beer, rancid coffee, and twisted cigarette butts in dirty ashtrays. He turns to his side slightly, and his eyes suddenly go wide beneath the mask.<br><br>What the fuck!<br><br>His heart thunders in his ears as he stares at a yellowing wall covered with caricatures of his favorite killers throughout history. His face tenses. He grinds his molars and tries to suppress the thing beneath the mask. He needs to take a moment, compose himself, and walk away.<br><br>Don’t look at it. Just don’t look at it…<br><br>But he can’t help himself. You don’t laugh at legends…<br><br>He reaches out and touches a caricature of the one they called The Miner. You don’t laugh at legends… His mouth gapes open. His lips tremble. He hasn’t felt like this in years.<br><br>You don’t! Laugh! At legends!<br><br>He tries to turn away but his feet are blocks of cement. He feels prickles all over his body as blood courses violently through his veins and something contained begins to stir.<br><br>He closes his eyes and counts to ten. He hasn’t improvised since his first design and that didn’t go very well. He has to find his center.<br><br>Walk away.<br><br>Just walk away.<br><br>For the design.<br><br>He stares up at the wall of parody and takes a deep breath. He closes his eyes and counts down from ten. Then he opens his eyes to see all the warped and ridiculous faces laughing at him.<br><br>He wants to ignore them. He wants to walk away. He has to walk away. But something won’t let him. And before he realizes what’s happening the thing contained breaks free. He clenches his fist and smashes it against the wall.<br><br>Fuck the design!"
MEMORY 1306,Tome13_02,"Mikaela rubs the back of her neck as she prepares to tell a story. Her face is warm, her throat is tight, and her legs feel like mush. She talks to herself under her breath.<br><br>Get a grip… get a grip…<br><br>But she can’t get a grip. Every breath, a struggle. Every movement, a jab in the gut. Her heart drums in her ears. Her brain perceives a threat, and her adrenal glands release a sudden surge of hormones. Adrenaline. Cortisol. The drum beats faster as terror paralyzes her. But this fear isn’t physical. She isn’t afraid of being burned alive or thrown off a cliff or dropped in a dark pit of writhing vipers.<br><br>What she dreads is standing on stage in front of strangers.<br><br>And telling them a story.<br><br>Ask people their greatest fear and the same one always sits at the top of the list. Public speaking. Why would that be? What makes embarrassment so much more terrifying than dismemberment?<br><br>Storytelling is as old as human history and Mikaela knows it’s imbedded in her DNA. It’s how she makes sense of the world. How she makes sense of herself. How she connects with others and communicates her truth. Finding that connection is Mikaela’s addiction.<br><br>She could write her stories to be read or just let someone else tell them, but Mikaela knows she needs more. Much more. She needs the fear, the adrenaline, the fight-or-flight feeling. But most of all she needs that visceral connection with her audience. So they see what she sees. Believes what she believes. Feels what she feels. Every eye watching her. Hanging on her every word.<br><br>Thursdays is open mic night at Moonstone. She told all her friends to come and she doesn’t want to let them down.<br><br>She doesn’t want to let herself down."
MEMORY 1315,Tome13_02,"The Moonstone is dead quiet and packed to the rafters.<br><br>Mikaela’s written and rewritten, polished and burnished, practiced alone and in front of her friends. Honed every word. Every moment. Every movement. Every breath. She killed her darlings. Anything extraneous. All that’s left is only what’s necessary to tell the tale.<br><br>She moves across the tiny stage, commanding the room. The lights dim slowly. She waits until the audience goes quiet. Then she clears her throat and begins.<br><br>Who here believes in love? I mean really believes in love?<br><br>Some audience members lift their hand or make a quick comment that they do.<br><br>Mikaela nods.<br><br>Love makes us do crazy things, doesn’t it?<br><br>Several audience members laugh and while others seem to go inward.<br><br>Mikaela smiles.<br><br>Some would turn their back on family for love. Some would give up wealth and power for love. Some would even go to hell and back for love. But there are places in the cosmos far worse than hell. Places where death is just the beginning, and you could lose your soul.<br><br>Would you go to such a place to bring back the one you love?<br><br>Mikaela stops and points at one audience member, and then another, and another.<br><br>Do you know anyone who would? What I’m really asking is: Does love truly conquer all?<br><br>She soaks in the silence of her captivated audience, inching closer to the edge of the stage, lowering her voice an octave so the audience leans in. And just when they can’t take anymore, she answers her question with a story."
MEMORY 1307,Tome13_02,"Mikaela sits at her kitchen table and tries to write, but nothing’s good enough. Every idea seems vapid. Dull. Stupid. Everything she can think of has already been done.<br><br>She wants to tap into people’s deepest fears. Transport them to another reality. Hypnotize them. Hold them spellbound.<br><br>And for that she needs a good story. An amazing story. Something that hooks. Something that raises questions the audience needs answered.<br><br>Because standing up in front of her friends is one thing, but strangers is quite another.<br><br>Her stomach lurches. She feels nauseous. She wants to purge her angst and that piece of banana bread she had with lunch. She loves coffee, but all that caffeine isn’t helping her anxiety.<br><br>Why would anyone want to listen to her? What does she have to say that anyone would want to hear?<br><br>That’s why her story has to be perfect. Surprising. Terrifying. Visceral. Shocking. Flawless. Original. And none of her ideas seem good enough.<br><br>Not one."
MEMORY 1308,Tome13_02,"Mikaela lets the last patron saunter out of the Moonstone and locks the door. She washes all the mugs and trays and scoops. Cleans and turns off the espresso machine. Wipes out the fridge. Sweeps the floor. She works until she exhausts herself before she sits down to write.<br><br>The fear seizes her almost immediately. Sweat beads on her forehead. Drips down her nose. Lands on the yellow legal pad, smearing the ink.<br><br>It’s not failure that terrifies her. It’s exile. Banishment. Being driven from the tribe. Isolated. Alone.<br><br>Alone.<br><br>She arrived at a new school in second grade and didn’t know a soul. She sat alone at lunch and tried to eat her tuna sandwich, but she couldn’t swallow a bite. She had no appetite. Just a lump in her throat. She still remembers that loneliness in her bones. That aloneness is more terrifying than dying. It’s primal.<br><br>She tried telling a story at the Moonstone before, and it didn’t go as planned. She decided to memorize the story so she wouldn’t have to keep glancing down at her paper. But one look at the audience and she couldn’t remember the first word. She froze and stood there like an idiot. Ten seconds felt like ten minutes and finally she just walked away. She can still feel the heat of embarrassment burning the back her neck.<br><br>When Comedians don’t get a laugh they call it dying.<br><br>It’s worse than dying."
MEMORY 1309,Tome13_02,"Mikaela knows her fear is rooted deep. In a tiny part of her brain called the amygdala. It’s instinct. It’s automatic. But knowing that doesn’t help.<br><br>She has to override that fear. She has to silence all those voices in her head.<br><br>Anyone who ever undermined her. Talked down to her. Doubted her. Made her think she wasn’t good enough.<br><br>Like her teachers.<br><br>Like Mrs. Stenson, her second-grade teacher who didn’t know how to teach dyslexic children and who made her feel shame for every misread or misspelled word.<br><br>Like Mr. Brandies, her tenth-grade English teacher who marked up her stories with tons of red ink. Always the red ink. He had so many stupid rules. Don’t repeat words. Don’t split infinitives. Don’t start sentences with conjunctions. Don’t end sentences with a preposition.<br><br>Don’t. Don’t. Don’t.<br><br>He was all about how not to do it.<br><br>All about making her doubt her instincts and intuition as a storyteller. All about murdering her joy and killing her creativity with rules that were never even rules in the first place. Rules that made her stories feel unfriendly, contrived, artificial. And she wanted her stories to be the opposite. The exact opposite—friendly, inviting, honest.<br><br>Mikaela remembers arguing with Brandies often about his so-called rules and how some of the greatest stories ever told started almost every sentence with a conjunction. She even challenged Brandies to show her where his rules came from. And he had nothing to say. Nothing to show her. Nothing official, anyway. Just one literary cookbook contradicting the other. Mikaela figured one teacher long ago taught a preferred style as a set of rules and that misguided class went out into the world propagating stylistic disinformation.<br><br>She remembers one time when Brandies handed back her story. She remembers him leaning over her desk. She remembers that smell. The smell of cheap aftershave fighting a losing battle with his B.O. And she hears his ugly words every time she picks up a pen.<br><br>Some people are born writers. You’re not. Don’t worry, it’s not your fault. It’s just who you are.<br><br>But even with all that negativity, she still managed to keep a tiny flame of inspiration alive. A sputtering flame nurtured by all the writers she'd loved. Mary Shelley. Edgar Allan Poe. Shirley Jackson. They didn’t worry about following rules. They just created their characters. Told their stories. Built their worlds."
MEMORY 1310,Tome13_02,"Something about the woman keeps others at a distance. Maybe it’s her intensity. Maybe it’s her detachment. Her otherworldliness.<br><br>Even in this dark, dangerous place, she seems more connected to the flora. To the trees. The shrubs. The night blooming flowers. The climbing vines. The crickets chirping their night song. The moths drawn to the tiny pockets of light that penetrate the heavy black fog. The rats scurrying through the brush. She can sit for hours watching a spider spin its web. That’s what holds her interest. The living things that somehow continue to thrive in this grim and wicked place.<br><br>She can’t read people the way others can. She can’t look at someone’s face and understand what they’re feeling. The language of human emotion is indecipherable. Her kind, intelligent eyes are framed by big plastic glasses. Her complexion is dark.

Why so many cultures have the same stories and mythologies.<br><br>Her muscles loosen under the hot spray and she remembers a writing circle where they talked about something called Dejavuism. The idea being that human brains could network with mirror beings on the same wavelength in other dimensions. One guy in the group thought that his inner voice was just another version of himself in a parallel dimension. Others in the circle laughed. She didn’t. She even shared one of her stories based on a recurring nightmare.<br><br>The hot water loses its heat and Mikaela suddenly turns it off just as she’s struck by an epiphany. What if she’s dreaming real things in a sort of multiverse? What if this world made of nightmares is not a plane of existence separate from the daily reality we all experience? What if it’s just one of many realities all existing at the same time. And if there are indeed multiple realities, it occurs to her that every story she creates while asleep or awake might simply be a glimpse into another plane of existence.<br><br>Mikaela shivers with excitement. Maybe all the stories already exist and are just waiting for her to discover them.

I just need to tell a good story.<br><br>Mikaela clears her head of the swirling negativity and decides to tell the story she wants to tell. She’ll need to reduce the story. Strip it to its core. Cut anything that slows it down. Change the passive to the active. Use words that paint perfect images in the imagination. And if she doesn’t have the right word, she’ll make one up. That’s what she’ll do. She’ll make one up! But as the rebellious thought inspires her, it also scares her. Scares the hell out of her because she was taught to idolize final results instead of the struggle, the search, and the climatic fight every artist must go through to be free.<br><br>To be truly free.<br><br>The shackles are still there. She feels them dragging her down, but they’re not as heavy as they used to be. And though she may not possess Shakespearean freedom yet—<br><br>She can fake it.<br><br>For now.<br><br>And now, she rises to her feet and paces the living room as she recites the first draft of her story. She finds places for dramatic pauses. Places to add a gesture. Places to speed up. Places to shock the audience into gasping or screaming. She won’t just play to them, she’ll play with them. And she won’t just tell the story, she’ll live the story, so the audience lives it with her."
Journal of a Moving Picture. Blood and Feathers.,Tome13_03,"A chicken suddenly appeared in the basement near all those strange devices. We chased it up and down the tower until finally Elaine caught it, and, grabbing the bird by the legs, continuously pummelled it against the stone floor until the whole room filled with blood, feathers and screams. She seemed a little disturbed by her sudden loss of control. We all were. With the torn chicken legs still in her hands, she kept on mumbling repeatedly that she’s usually quite patient and in control, and, for the life of her, she did not understand the emotions that had suddenly and temporarily hijacked her. We consoled poor Elaine as we gathered the chunks of poultry and prepared a delicious meal. A good scene to include in the picture for levity."
Journal of a Moving Picture. Never Forgotten.,Tome13_03,"Elaine Fairfield told me how she met Ahma Kimura and the Parks. They met in a group dedicated to finding missing loved ones led by a brother who lost his sister while investigating strange yet similar disappearances. The group eventually figured out a way to enter this cosmic hell with the brother’s research but were somehow separated along the way. She says they were attacked by a creature she couldn’t really describe but that it seemed to be everywhere and nowhere at the same time. I didn’t really understand what she was going on about. Whatever it was, I’m glad they found me and pulled me out of the bear trap when they did. I’m also glad the brother entrusted Mr. Park with the research before they were separated, and I hope there is something in there that will help us return home. Otherwise, we’ll probably end up doing to each other what Elaine did to that poor chicken. On that note, Yasmine Kassir didn’t find the chicken incident very funny, nor did she think it would make a good scene in a moving picture. I’m not sure she represents the target audience I’m after."
Dear Jake,Tome13_03,"I sit before my journal and don’t know what to write. I would like to continue searching the fog for you but Bridgette feels we need to rest and that there is much we can learn from the previous occupant of this tower. I suppose the only thing I can do now is float with the tide and hope we find something here that brings us closer to the ones we’ve lost. A few of us gathered around a small fire in the study and told stories about loved ones we’ve all heard a hundred times but acted like it’s the first time. I suppose that’s because we know it helps to talk, laugh and remember the good times. Ahma told us about her little girl building motorcycle engines—upgrading scooters and racing them in her small village. This version was a little more embellished than the last. No one can be that good on a scooter even if it had been modified or upgraded with plane parts. Nevertheless, they were amusing stories, and she told them well up until the moment she stopped abruptly, staring blankly at the fire, lost in a memory. No one said anything for a long while. I stared at the leaping flames and thought of the time you first learned to ride a bicycle. You were four years old and the first thing I taught you was how to fall. I told you to push yourself with your feet and fall safely to the left or right side. We practiced falling safely until the fear of falling was gone. Then I showed you how to pedal fast and use the speed to keep your balance. You succeeded on your first try because you were no longer scared of falling. You were so happy you jumped off your bike, hugged me and told me I was the best dad in the world. If I were to die today and live in that moment forever I would be a blessed man. I miss you with all my heart and hate what happened between us. I only hope for another chance to make things right."
Chamber of Blood. Day of Night. Jaden. 1.,Tome13_03,"Twenty-three-year-old Jaden pushed through the fog as he approached the entrance of an abandoned motel. He wiped the cold sweat from his brow, opened the creaking door and entered the dark lobby. At once his heart sank as he stared upon a grim scene of death. Strewn across the floor were human corpses and the decaying remains of squid-like creatures, unlike anything he had ever seen before. He took a moment to compose himself. His bruised face, swollen feet and tattered clothes gave testament to the long and arduous journey through this dark dimension to find his adopted sister, Haley. Back home, he had connected with others who had lost loved ones in similar circumstances and together they had collected relics and artifacts with secret symbols that eventually helped them open a portal into this world made of nightmares. But no sooner had they entered the nightmare than they had been separated while being attacked by a shadow creature with an insatiable appetite for darkness.<br><br>Now Jaden was alone. Without the research—or the ‘codex’ as some of them had grown accustomed to calling it—he wasn’t sure how he would escape when he found his sister. But he tried not to think about his predicament as he entered the lobby feeling like something or someone was watching him. Some distance away he had found the ruins of a tower with skeletons strewn across a mini-putt with an old French song playing on a scratchy gramophone. Now he was in an abandoned motel, reeking dead creatures around him. He didn’t know what else to expect, but he was sure of one thing: more deadly creatures and mysterious ruins would be in the fog. Much more. Everything he had discovered about this world suggested it was a garden of infinite darkness beyond time and space.<br><br>Death—he had read—was not an escape.<br><br>Cautiously, Jaden walked down a deathly silent corridor with shaking hands toward a door. Above the door an exit sign blinked in and out of existence. The only sign of life was a rat the size of a dog chewing on the putrid flesh of one of the bloated squid creatures. As he passed a pile of bodies, he felt something behind him. He turned to see a sudden flash. An instant later he was staring down the edge of a gleaming katana. He gasped as he found himself staring at a woman in a red and black kimono. She reminded him of a protagonist in a story Haley had been collecting by an anonymous eighteenth century Japanese author.<br><br>“Saku, wait!”<br><br>Jaden’s heart gave a great leap as he instantly recognized Surin’s voice. He turned to see several other familiar faces amongst a small group of survivors. Beyond the faces he recognized—Olivia, Sean and Elias—he thought he saw Haley’s estranged uncle, Mahan, in blood-stained fatigues, carrying a semi-automatic rifle.<br><br>Surin urgently turned to face a woman beside him. “Ariella,” he said. “Tell Saku we know him. His name is Jaden. He came with us through the portal but we got separated. This place… it has his sister.”<br><br>Ariella nodded, then gently placed her hand on Saku’s wrist, translating Surin’s words into Japanese. Within moments, Saku nodded her understanding and lowered her katana.<br><br>Jaden breathed again as Surin tossed him a rifle and a rusty machete, then introduced him to the new members of the group and told everyone to prepare for another assault from the fog. An instant later they dispersed to barricade and fortify the motel."
Journal of a Moving Picture. Entry 89.,Tome13_03,Started writing early in the morning. Two pages completed. Focused on the chicken episode which entertains in a number of ways. Discussion with Yasmine is planned for tonight and will likely miss Elaine’s reading of a story chosen from the Chamber of Blood. Something Wicked This Halloween. Elaine claims the story is set in a world not unlike this one.
Chamber of Blood. Lost and Forgotten.,Tome13_03,"A REVERBERATING EXPLOSION somewhere in the distance roused the five prisoners in their small, muddy, vermin-infested dungeon. One bearded prisoner sat up and stared at several names etched in a rock by the door. It read:<br><br>Amar Singh 1914<br><br>Adama Comba 1915<br><br>Omar Halimi 1916<br><br>Amrik 1917<br><br>Rup 1917<br><br>The prisoner had the sudden instinct to etch his own name lest he be forgotten. And so, he grabbed a small, sharp stone and just as he began to etch out his name, the thick wooden door slammed open and enemy soldiers shouted curses at the five prisoners in a language none of them understood while threatening them with gleaming bayonets.<br><br>The enemy soldiers gestured for them to stand, then ushered the five prisoners out of the darkness and into the golden light of dawn through a muddy, six-foot trench reeking of death.<br><br>As the prisoners hobbled toward a clearing, one soldier addressed them in broken English, telling them they had the honor of helping their captain and perhaps avoiding early morning target practice.<br><br>*<br><br>THE FIVE PRISONERS stood by the trench wall as an enemy soldier balanced tin cans over their heads. A translator approached them with the captain. The captain spoke, and the translator quickly interpreted, saying:<br><br>“One of you bastards will tell me about your secret mission. Speak up and I promise to send you to a proper camp where you will be fed and given immediate medical attention.”<br><br>None of the five responded. The captain smirked, took twenty paces back, cocked his rifle, aimed and hit one soldier in the forehead, splitting his skull in two, sending a spray of blood across the other four.<br><br>The captain regarded them, hesitated, then cocked the rifle again. A sudden crack and another prisoner fell as the captain mockingly apologized for his terrible aim.<br><br>With a laugh, the captain aimed the rifle, squeezed the trigger, and hit the tin can. The can fell against the sandbags lining of the trench and clattered against debris. The captain prepared his rifle and shifted his aim to the next prisoner.<br><br>The prisoner stared at the rifle, closed his eyes, and repeated a phrase in an unknown language that resembled Latin. And just as the captain made to pull the trigger, a sudden piercing whistle suddenly caught everyone’s attention. By the time the captain looked up, it was already too late, and he was reduced to fleshy fragments and bone shrapnel by an eighteen-pounder.<br><br>*<br><br>THE BEARDED PRISONER CRAWLED on the ground toward a trembling hand sticking out of a pile of debris. He frantically dug through the dirt and rubble as muffled screams and explosions filled his ears. Breathing hard, he managed to dig out one face and then another. Then he rose on shaking legs, grabbed one prisoner by the uniform and pulled him to his feet. Together they yanked the other prisoner from a mountain of rubble and took a moment to gather themselves. Limping and coughing, they grabbed rifles from the ground, rushed toward a ladder and climbed over the trench and into the barren wasteland.<br><br>Leaping over decomposing horses, bullets thumped in the mud all around the fleeing prisoners as they fell into a massive crater. As they desperately scrambled out, jumping over bodies and rats and pushing through clouds of flies, they suddenly and unexpectedly entered a maze of barbed wire attached to the scorched remains of trees. Pushing their way out of the maze, they once again entered a clearing and sprinted away without looking back until—<br><br>They heard the rumble of an engine in the sky.<br><br>They turned to see the plane. One prisoner froze, grabbed his rifle and aimed as the plane approached them. Holding his breath, he pulled the trigger and large crows took flight from corpses as the bullet screamed through the air and—<br><br>Missed.<br><br>He cocked the rifle again, calmed his nerves, and waiting for the right moment, squeezed the trigger. This time the bullet howled through the sky and hammered straight through the pilot’s hardened face.<br><br>A moment later the plane rose, then span wildly out of control.<br><br>The prisoners watched in disbelief as the plane crashed into their pursuers, crushing and cutting and burning them up in a swirling ball of fire.<br><br>As they took in the grisly scene, the world seemed to tremble violently and the ground beneath their feet instantly disappeared. The three prisoners fell, arms flailing, into a massive sink hole as dust, soot and barbed wire covered them.<br><br>*<br><br>WHEN THE DUST settled, the three prisoners surveyed their surroundings to discover they were in an ancient temple immersed in a strange black fog and arcane symbols etched in the surrounding walls. They had inadvertently discovered the lost temple they had been sent out to find before the secret enemy units that had been created to secure hidden occult knowledge all over the world. Now all they had to do was report their discovery to the newly formed Intelligence Division.<br><br>And so the prisoners desperately climbed out of the temple and found themselves in familiar yet unfamiliar territory. The bleak, body-ridden landscape seemed like No Man’s Land, but there was something strange about the scene. All around were mazelike walls of barbed wire and scorched trees where bodies dangled from hooks that glistened red under a hunter’s moon. Each prisoner stared at the bodies and the hooks confused, each wondering if they had been there before.<br><br>The sudden high-pitch buzz of a chainsaw startled the prisoners, and they instinctively took cover beside a burning tank. As a cloud of heaving black fog approached them, they knew something was different with the hell they had grown accustomed to for the last three years.<br><br>They sensed that they had somehow discovered something lost and forgotten to time in the hidden temple, or that this lost and forgotten thing had somehow discovered them and that this thing, this ancient thing—whatever it was—had pushed them out of the frying pan and into the cosmic fire."
Chamber of Blood. Office of Strategic Magik.,Tome13_03,Memo: Concerning Dr. Stamper. We are concerned about having Stamper lead Subproject 774. He openly mocks the premise of herd manifestation and his suggestions for the community have an air of skepticism if not sarcasm to them. He continues to question the department and doesn’t believe the government has the resources to conduct such an experiment. He requests to know where the funding is coming from and asks too many questions. I don’t believe he’s the right candidate to lead the Herd Initiative.
